The original experiments with rats applied the following protocol: A male rat was placed into an enclosed large box with four or five female rats in heat.[11] He immediately began to mate with all the female rats repeatedly until he eventually became exhausted.[11] The females continued nudging and licking him, yet he did not respond.[11] When a novel female was introduced into the box, he became alert and began to mate once again with the new female.[11] This phenomenon is not limited to common rats.[12]

The Coolidge effect is attributed to an increase in dopamine levels and the subsequent effect upon an animal's limbic system.[13] In a study conducted by Fiorino et al., male rats were used to study the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system on their sexual behaviour.[13] In their experiment, microdialysis was used to monitor dopamine efflux from the nucleus accumbens during three stages of sexual behaviour, these included: copulation, sexual satiety, and the reinitiation of sexual behaviour.[13] Behavioural testing for the Coolidge effect consisted of several phases including, copulation with a female, reintroduction to the same female, access to the same female, introduction to a novel female, and copulation with the novel female.[13] During these phases, dopamine and its metabolites were monitored.[13] Results from this study found that overall there was a significant increase in dopamine efflux in response to both the first female and the second female.[13] During copulation with the first female, concentrations of dopamine in these male rats showed a significant increase, however, when the same female was presented again, a significant increase in dopamine was not observed.[13] When a novel female was presented, initially, there was a small increase in the levels of dopamine, however, after continued copulation with the novel female, a significant increase in dopamine levels was observed.[13] From these results, they concluded that an increase in mesolimbic dopamine efflux is associated with the appetitive and consummatory stages of sexual behaviour in male rats.[13] Their data also suggest that stimuli associated with a novel female may increase dopamine transmission in a rat that is sexually satiated, and hence have a role in the reinitiation of sexual behaviour.[13]

Additional studies have also provided further evidence for the role of the nucleus accumbens on sexual behaviour in rats.[14] In a study conducted by Wood et al., male rats were divided into three conditions, and were presented with a cotton ball laden in either saline (control group), estrous vaginal smear of a familiar female (experimental group), and estrous vaginal smear of a novel female (experimental group).[14] In this experiment, the role of the nucleus accumbens was characterized through recording neuronal activity of single cells in this area of the brain.[14] Results from this study showed a greater proportion of neuronal activation when initially presented with a novel estrus stimulus in comparison to familiar estrus stimulus.[14] Subsequent presentations of the novel estrus stimulus did not show an increase neuronal activity.[14]
