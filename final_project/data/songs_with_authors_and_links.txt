Title: Life Is A Highway
Lyrics:
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way I want to drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
There was a distance between you and I
A misunderstanding once but now
We look it in the eye
There ain't no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Title: Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
Lyrics:
Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prays
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Title: Things That Make You Go Hmmm
Lyrics:
Things that make you go hmm
I was at the crib, sittin' by the fireplace
Drinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug
The door bell rang. Who could it be?
Thought to myself then started to shrug
Got to the door. Ding Dong. Who is it?
My girl's best friend had payed me a visit.
Sly as can be, tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful. I really didn't have the gall.
I tried to chill. She made the move.
Now I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve.
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girl didn't trust me. No!
Yeah, but she lost control I wouldn't take the bait.
I said chill baby baby chill baby baby wait
My girl bust in, Caught us creating a boom
She said "Girlfriend"?
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm, hmm, hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Here's how it started
Just an example of how another brother can trample
Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind
There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say hey
I watched the fight. I thought is was alright.
'Cause me and Jay were really really tight
So damned close we had the same blood type.
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill
He had his own room and helped pay the bills
The time had come (for the baby down to the scene)
It looked like Jay and I couldn't believe
Before my eyes in the delivery room.
The things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
The things that make you go hmm, hmm, hmm
The things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
The things that make you go hmm.
Robbie Rob - break it down!
Give it to me Give it to me Give it to me Give it to me (x7)
Give it to me Give it to me
Seventeen and I was havin' a ball
Eleventh grade and "Joe" I knew it all
I fell in love for the very first time
With this girl she really blew my mind
Inner sense and whole lotta class
Style that could give you whiplash
We said hello and my heart be stopped
She was the world and I was on top
Time went by, She filled my universe
We made love, She said I was the first
My boy kept tellin' me. Yo, I don't know
I think your girl's been playing tic tac toe
I'll ask my girl I know she only loves me
Wasn't I the one who tool your viginity?
The look on her face read sorrow and gloom
She said "Yeah, Why do you guys always ask that?"
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Hey ladies
Have you ever had a man
Go away for business, come back with a tan
Comes home late at night from work
You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk
Sayin' he didn't have time to eat
And he's not even hungry, he wants to be treat
To the bedroom he said his head hurts
You're only makin' love in radical spurts
Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself "I'm gonna hit him with a brick"
Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me
I wonder who bought him those BVD's
Dressed to a T to hang with the fellas
Over the guys and I'm getting jealous
Comin' home late smellin' like perfume (fume)
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
It's the things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm
Things that make you go hmm

Title: From The Sea
Lyrics:
Ooh I'm so spaced out today
Ooh I could have slept for days
It's like a radar and it comes to you from the sea
From the sea
From the sea
Ooh she's just so underpain
Ooh I'm so spaced out today
My heads a light way and it comes to you from the sea
From the sea
From the sea
Hello, hello, oh hello
(The world repeats itself somehow)
She knows, she knows, oh she knows
(The world repeats itself somehow)
Only just beginning to know
She's only just beginning to know
Ooh there's just no oxygen
Ooh why can't we just fall in in the sea
Hello, hello, oh hello
(The world repeats itself somehow)
She knows, she knows, oh she knows
(The world repeats itself somehow)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hello, hello, oh hello
(The world repeats itself somehow)
She knows, she knows, oh she knows
(The world repeats itself somehow)
Only just beginning to know
She's only just beginning to know
She's only just beginning to know now

Title: Every Rose Has Its Thorn
Lyrics:
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
[Chorus:]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess
[Chorus]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
I know I could have saved a love that night if I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess
[Chorus]

Title: Hey Baby
Lyrics:
Girls say, boys say
I'm the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my make-up bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words
I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back
I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back
Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and No Doubt
Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby
Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Now, if now maybe
I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
When you rock your hips
You know that it amaze me
Boys say, boys say
All the boys get the girls in the back

Title: Black Velvet
Lyrics:
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancing' with a baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
If you please
If you please
If you please

Title: Into The Night
Lyrics:
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes
No room left to move in between you and I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
(And the voices rang like the angels sing)
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh)
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh)
Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh)
And we danced on into the night

Title: Devil Inside
Lyrics:
Here come the woman
With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind
Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die
Other half die
Makes you wonder
Oh-oh-wonder
Here come the man
With the look in his eye
Fed on nothing
But full of pride
Look at them go
Look at them kick
Makes you wonder
How the other half live
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Here come the world
With the look in its eye
Future uncertain
But certainly slight
Look at the faces
Listen to the bells
It's hard to believe
We need a place called hell
A place called hell
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
Here comes the woman
With the look in her eye
She's raised on leather
With flesh on her mind
Words are weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside
The devil inside
The devil inside
Every single one of us
The devil inside

Title: Elevation
Lyrics:
Yeah, yeah
High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul
I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly so high
Elevation
A star lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly so high
Elevation
Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly so high
Elevation
Elevation
Elevation
Elevation
Elevation

Title: Sexual Healing
Lyrics:
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Oh, baby now let's get down tonight
Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
And when I get that feelin'
I want sexual healin'
Sexual healin', oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healin' baby, is good for me
Sexual healin' is something that's good for me
Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leavin' me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby
And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealin'
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healin'
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right
Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'
And when I get that feelin'
I want sexual healin'
Sexual healin' is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healin', baby, it's good for me
Sexual healin' is something that's good for me
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me, my baby, ohh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be makin' it, honey
I'll be feelin' fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in
Darlin', you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate
(Healing, my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feelin'
I need sexual healin'
Oh when I get this feelin'
I need sexual healin'
I gotta have sexual healin', darlin'
'Cause I'm all alone
Sexual healin', darlin'
Till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate

Title: Wired For Sound
Lyrics:
I like small speakers, I like tall speakers
If they've music they've wired for sound
Walkin' about with a head full of music
Cassette in my pocket and I'm gonna use it
Stereo out on the street you know, woh oh woh
Into the car go to work I'm cruisin'
I never think that I'll blow all my fuses
Traffic flows into the breakfast show, woh oh woh
Power from the needle to the plastic
A.M., F.M. I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found and I'm wired for sound
I was small boy who don't like his toys
I could not wait to get wired for sound
I met a girl and she told me she loved me
I said you love me then love means you must like what I like
My music is dynamite, woh oh woh
She said,? I'm not a girl you put on at a stand by
I am a girl who demands that her love is amplified
Switch in to overdrive, woh oh woh?
Power from the needle to the plastic
A.M, F.M I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found and I'm wired for sound
Power from the needle to the plastic
A.M, F.M I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found as I'm wired for sound
I like small speakers, I like tall speakers
If they've music they've wired for sound
I like small speakers, I like tall speakers
If they've music they've wired for sound
I like small speakers, I like tall speakers
If they've music they've wired for sound
I like small speakers, I like tall speakers
Wall speakers most of all I like loud speakers

Title: If You Could Only See
Lyrics:
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue
Her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me
Well you got your reasons
And you got your lies
And you got your manipulations
They cut me down to size
Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue
Her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me
Seems the road less traveled
Shows happiness unraveled
And you got to take a little dirt
To keep what you love
That's what you gotta do
Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't
You're stretching out your arms
To something that's just not there
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue
Her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me
Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue
Her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Title: Mad World
Lyrics:
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression
No expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow
No tomorrow
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
Cuz I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me
Look right through me
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
Cuz I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
Cuz I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very very
Mad world
Mad world
Halargian world
Mad world

Title: Something So Strong
Lyrics:
Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all
Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today
Somthing so strong...

Title: Wish You Well
Lyrics:
Up so early feel so bright
didn't get much sleep last night
freight train rattled through my head
whistle blowing love is dead
is dead
Heart attacked by fear and doubt
won't be long till the truth comes out
first impressions never last
lover's bonds they hold so fast
Restless future burning bright
the past is holding on so tight
never heard the warning bell
and I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well
Welcome swallows dip and swing
take their cue from the slightest thing
rolling fog into my room
why did you give up on me so soon?
so soon
Restless future burning bright
the past is holding on so tight
never heard the warning bell
and I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well
Why did you give up on me so soon?
did you give up on me so soon?
I just want to wish you well
I just want to wish you well

Title: Hold On
Lyrics:
I know this pain (I know this pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains? (these chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind (mmm)
Is it really fair to feel, this way inside? (woah)
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold... on for one more day
Can you hold... on for one more day?
Things'll go your way...
Hold on for one more day
You could sustain (you could sustain)
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (no, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (oooh...)
Lettin' your worries pass you by (lettin' your worries pass you by)
Baby, don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind? (no, no)
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold... on for one more day
Can you hold... on for one more day?
Things'll go your way (oh, things'll go your way)
Hold on for one more day
I know that there is pain, but you
Hold on for one more day, and ya
Break free from the chains...
Yeah I know that there is pain, but you
Hold for one more day, and ya
Break free, break from the chains
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye (and say goodbye)
Until then, baby, are you going to let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know, things can change (know)
Things'll go your way
If you hold... on for one more day, yeah
Can you hold... on...
Don't you know, things could change
Things could go your way
If you hold... on for one more day
Can you hold... on
Can you hold on
Mmm, can you hold on, baby
Won't you tell me now
Hold on for one more day, cause
It's gonna go your way
Don't you know, things could change
Things could go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
Can't you change it this time
Make up your mind
Hold on, hold on
Baby hold on

Title: Walk Of Life
Lyrics:
Woohoo, woohoo.
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion.
He turnin' all the night time into the day
The song about the sweet ole lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Here comes Johnny gonna tell you a story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat, the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
He turnin' all the night time into the day
The song about the sweet ole lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
He turnin' all the night time into the day
And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, do the walk of life
Hm, you do the walk of life.
Woohoo
Woohoohoo

Title: Bad To The Bone
Lyrics:
On the day I was born
The nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder
At the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up
Said "leave this one alone"
She could tell right away
That I was bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone
I broke a 1000 hearts
Before I met you

Before I am through
I wanna be yours pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya honey
That I'm bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-Bad

And make a young girl squeal

B-B-B-B-Bad

Title: Outside
Lyrics:
(Let's go outside)
Outside, Outside...
(Let's go outside)
Back to nature
Just human nature
Hidden in the back
I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby
Let's go outside (let's go outside) in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yeah
Let's go outside in the moonshine
Take me to the places that I love best
So my angel, she says, don't you worry
'bout the things they're saying, yeah
Got no friends in high places and the game that you gave away
wasn't worth playing
Let's go outside in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yeah
Let's go outside in the meantime
Take me to the places that I love best
And yes, I've been bad
Doctor, won't you do with me what you can
You see I think about it all the time, twenty-four seven
(Twenty- four, twenty-four seven)
You say you want it, you got it
I never really said it before
There's nothing here, but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more
There's nothing more, oh, oh, oh
Back to nature, just human nature
Getting on back to -
I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby
Let's go outside in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yeah
Let's go outside in the moonshine
Take me to the places that I love best
And yes, I've been bad
Doctor, won't you do with me what you can
you see I think about it all the time
I'd service the community but I already have you see
I never really said it before
There's nothing here, but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more
There's nothing more
Let's go outside
Dancing on the D-train, baby
(You want it, you got it)
When the moon is high
(You want it, you got it)
And the grass is jumpin'
Come on, just keep on funkin'
(I'm dancing on the D-train)
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'
I'm dancing on the D-train
I'm dancing on the D-train...

Title: Opposites Attract
Lyrics:
I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my home girl, Paula Abdul
Baby seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night
Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cuz I move slowly and baby I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
Who'd a thought we could be lovers
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy baby, I get obsessed
She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes, I like to smoke
Things in common, there just ain't a one
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun
I take two steps forward, two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
You know it baby, baby
Nothing in common but this trust
I'm like a minus, she's like a plus
One going up, one coming down
But we seem to land on common ground
When things go wrong we make corrections
To keep things moving in the right direction
Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack
It's useless, opposites attract
Baby ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long
You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cuz we're perfectly matched
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
Two steps forward, two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
Two steps forward, two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
It ain't fiction you know it's a fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
Two steps forward, two steps back
Two steps back 'cuz opposites attract
We come together, we go together
Opposites, I said, Opposites attract

Title: One Night In Bangkok
Lyrics:
Bangkok, Oriental Setting
But the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner
Time flies - doesn't seem a minute
since the Tirolean spa had the chess boards in it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings
Or ... or this place!
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board
not looking at the city
Whattaya mean?!
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
Tea, girls, warm and sweet, sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd, you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine!
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
or reclining Buddha
Thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it
I don't see you guys raging
The kind of mating I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you.
So, you better go back to your bars, your temples ...
your "massage parlors" ...
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Title: Thorn In My Side
Lyrics:
Yeah
You gave me such a bad time
Tried to hurt me
But now I know
Thorn in my side
You know that's all you ever were
A bundle of lies
You know that's all that it was worth
I should have known better
But I trusted you at first
I should have known better
But I got what I deserved
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
Thorn in my side
You know that's all you'll ever be
So don't think you know better
'Cause that's what you mean to me
I was feeling complicated
I was feeling low
Now every time I think of you
I shiver to the bone
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
To run away from you
Was all that I could do
To run away from you
Was all that I could do

Title: Live It Up
Lyrics:
How can you see looking through those tears
Don't you know you're worth your weight in gold
I can't believe that you're alone in here
Let me warm your hands against the cold
A close encounter with a hardhearted man
Who never gave half of what he got
Has made you wish you'd never been born
That's a shame cause you got the lot
Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up
If you smiled the walls would fall down
On all the people in this pickup joint
But if you laughed you'd level this town
Hey lonely girl that's just the point
Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up
Just answer me the question why
You stand alone by the phone in the corner and cry
How can you see looking through those tears
Don't you know you're worth your weight in gold
I can't believe that you're alone in here
Let me warm your hands against the cold
If you smiled the walls would fall down
On all the people in this pickup joint
But if you laughed you'd level this town
Hey lonely girl that's just the point
Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up
Let's live it up,
Live it up
Mmm live it up
Hey yeah you
With the sad face
Come up to my place
Come up to my place baby
Hey yeah you with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up
You with the sad face
Come up to my place and live it up
You beside the dance floor
What do you cry for let's live it up

Title: Always
Lyrics:
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time
That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Always, always

Title: Whatta Man
Lyrics:
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Hey hey
All right, oh yeah
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I wanna take a minute or two and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it, get me involved in that he said, she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
You so crazy, I think I wanna have your baby
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to Heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like seven eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin' and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cuz good men are hard to find
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
My man gives real lovin' that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham bam thank you ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cuz his Mama taught him that
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty, mighty good man
Do me like this sugar, yeah
Now break it down, break it down, one time
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

Title: Candy
Lyrics:
It's a rainy afternoon in 1990
The big city
Geez, it's been 20 years
Candy, you were so fine
Beautiful, beautiful girl from the North
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free
Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
Life is crazy
Candy baby
Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out but, but I miss you
I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along
Down on the street
Those men are all the same
I need a love, not games
Not games
Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
Life is crazy
I know baby
Candy baby
Oh oh oh oh, Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy
Life is crazy
Candy baby
Candy baby
Candy, Candy
Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go
All my life I'm waiting for you, loved you so
Candy, Candy, Candy
I can't let you go

Title: Deja Vu
Lyrics:
Bass (Uh)
Hi hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay? (Uh-huh.)
Ready? (Uh-huh.)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh. C'mon.)
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back
Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the strobe
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tippin' like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my, Oh
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Déjà Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Déjà Vu
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Déjà Vu

Title: Two Hearts
Lyrics:
Well, there was no reason to believe shed always be there
But if you dont put faith in what you believe in
Its getting you nowhere
Cos it hurts, you never let go
Dont look down, just look up
Cos shes always there to behind you, just to remind you
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know were two hearts believing in just one mind
Cos theres no easy way to, to understand it
Theres so much of my life in her, and its like Im blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
Theres so much love youll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know were two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
She knows (she knows)
Therell always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, Im always right there beside her
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know were two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time
You know were two hearts believing in just one mind
You know were two hearts believing in just one mind

Title: Hanging By A Moment
Lyrics:
Desperate for changing, starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Forgetting all I'm lacking, completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation, you take all of me now
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you
There's nothing else to lose, there's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world that can change my mind
There is nothing else
There is nothing else
There is nothing else
Desperate for changing, starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you
Just hanging by a moment
Just hanging by a moment
I'm hanging by a moment
Just hanging by a moment here with you

Title: Islands In The Stream
Lyrics:
Baby when I met you, there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine toothed comb
I was soft inside, there was something going on
You do something to me, that I can't explain
Hold me closer, and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Honest love, we feel, needs no conversation
And we ride it together, uh huh
Making love with each other, uh huh
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you just walk in the the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us, and we got no doubt
Too deep in love, and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh
(Sail away)
(Ohhh, sail away with me)
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Title: Dreadlock Holiday
Lyrics:
I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other
I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
Don't you walk thru my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet
Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be jokin' man
It was a present from me Mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home
And I say
I don't like reggae no no
I love it
I don't like reggae oh no
I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer on me pitch
Don't you walk thru my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet
I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' pina coladas
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder
She said I've got it you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it you'll like it
And wallow in a Dreadlock Holiday
And I say
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her oh yea
Don't you walk thru her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet
I don't like cricket
I love it (Dreadlock Holiday)
I don't like reggae
I love it (Dreadlock Holiday)
Don't like Jamaica
I love her (Dreadlock Holiday)
I hurried back to the swimming pool

Title: Forgotten Years
Lyrics:
Few of the sins of the father, are visited upon the son
Hearts have been hard, our hands have been clenched in a fist too long
Our sons need never be soldiers, our daughters will never need guns
These are the years between
These are the years that were hard fought and won
Contracts torn at the edges, old signatures stained with tears
Seasons of war and peace, these should not be forgotten years
Still it aches like tetanus, it reeks of politics
How many dreams remain? This is a feeling too strong to contain
The hardest years, the darkest years, the roarin' years, the fallen years
These should not be forgotten years
The hardest years, the wildest years, the desperate and divided years
We will remember, these should not be forgotten years
Our shoreline was never invaded, our country was never in flames
This is the calm we breathe, this is a feeling too strong to contain
Still it aches like tetanus, it reeks of politics
Signatures stained with tears, who can remember
We've got to remember
The hardest years, the darkest years, the roarin' years, the fallen years
These should not be forgotten years
The hardest years, the wildest years, the desperate and divided years
We will remember, these should not be forgotten years
The hardest years, the darkest years, the roarin' years, the fallen years
These should not be forgotten years
The hardest years, the wildest years, the desperate and divided years
We will remember, these should not be forgotten years
The hardest...
Forsaking aching breaking years, the time and tested heartbreak years
These should not be forgotten years
The blinded years, the binded years, the desperate and divided years
These should not be forgotten years, remember

Title: Mr Vain
Lyrics:
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
Call me Raider call me Wrong
Call me insane call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
of the man none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge that makes them
want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back the simple fact is
that i'm all that and i'm always near
one sexy can't perplex me now
You know who's raw
as if you didn't know before
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you and then I want a little more
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
Girls are all over the world
they hope and pray and die for men
Like me cause I'm the one
begotten son that breaks the mould
Get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab and hold
and squeeze real tight
Whose gonna be the one to save
you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
please oh baby please
You beg you want you say
You got to get some caught
Up in the charm that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere
to run
just another fish to fit the
worm on the hook of my line
Yeah I keep many females
longing for a chance to win my heart
with S E X and plenty

Title: Walking On Broken Glass
Lyrics:
Walking on Walking on broken glass
Walking on Walking on Broken Glass
You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar honey if I can't have you.
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass...
(Walking on walking on broken glass)
The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me.
O-o-oh let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me...
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass...
(Walking on walking on broken glass)
And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed.
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed...
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You do it really well my dear...
Now everyone of us was made to suffer
Everyone of us is made to weep
We've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep...
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking...
Walking on broken glass.
Don't let me keep on walking.
(Walking on walking on broken glass)

Title: Ben
Lyrics:
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben

Title: Tip Of My Tongue
Lyrics:
Tonight's the night I'm gonna
Make my true confession
Got my courage up
There's nothing that can keep me down now
My words get tangled up in good intentions
But I know what my heart wants to say, hey
I've got to let you know
For worse or for better
There's a hundred ways that I could show you
But it wouldn't matter
It's time to tell you
And I'll try to keep it simple
I know what you want to hear
Why do I forget every time you get near?
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
On the tip of my tongue
Look in my eyes and tell me what do you see
There's a message that I'm sending
And I hope you receive
Words get tangled up in good intentions
You know what my heart wants to say
Know what my heart's trying to say
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
On the tip of my tongue
Three little words that I want to say
You'll never know if you walk away
I know what you want to hear
Why do I forget every time you get near
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Three little words that I want to say
You'll never know if you walk away
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue
Right on the tip of my tongue

Lyrics:
Got myself into some trouble tonight
Guess I'm just feelin' blue
It's been so long
Since I've seen your face
This distance between me and you
That voice you showed me is not the one that I know
I must be strong now, in what I do
Don't hang up again
Theres nothing else I know how to do
But I burn for you
What am I gonna i do
i Burn for you
I guess it feels like you're always alone
And I feel that way too
It's so hard to explain to you
Please understand what I do
I burn for you
What am I gonna do
I burn for you
Burn for you
Took my trouble to a bar tonight
For another point of view
But there's nothing new
I'm missing you and
I burn for you
What am I gonna I do
I Burn for you
I Burn for you
I burn for you
What am I gonna I do
I burn for you

What am I gonna I do

Lyrics:
The world is a vampire,
Sent to drain
Secret destroyers,
Hold you up to the flames
And what do I get
For my pain?
Betrayed desires
And a piece of the game
Even though I know,
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold like old Job
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Now I'm naked,
Nothing but an animal
But can you fake it
For just one more show?
And what do you want?
I want to change
And what have you got,
When you feel the same?
Even though I know,
I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold like old Job
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son for you
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son for you
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved
And I still believe that I cannot be saved

Title: Urgent
Lyrics:
You're not shy, you get around
You wanna fly, don't want your feet on the ground
You stay up, you won't come down
You wanna live, you wanna move to the sound
Got fire in your veins
Burnin' hot but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane
You can't stop until you do it again
But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
That's why you call me in the middle of the night
You say it's urgent
So urgent, so oh oh urgent
Just wait and see
How urgent my love can be
It's urgent
You play tricks on my mind
You're everywhere but you're so hard to find
You're not warm or sentimental
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental
But I'm not looking for a love that will last
I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for each other anytime, anywhere
It gets so urgent
So urgent
You know it's urgent
I wanna tell you it's the same for me
So oh oh urgent
Just you wait and see
How urgent our love can be
It's urgent
You say it's urgent
Make it fast, make it urgent
Do it quick, do it urgent
Gotta rush, make it urgent
Want it quick
Urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, urgent, emergency
So urgent, emergency
Emer... emer... emer...
It's urgent

Title: Rush You
Lyrics:
Love is no fun anymore
There's too many things I can't afford
So what do you mean when you say
That she's your girlfriend today
I wouldn't ever wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Love's not beating down on my door
I guess it's cause ooh, I got lucky, lucky before
I wouldn't ever wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Wealth is boring without happiness
Fame is notorious for causing stress
Health is for binging on in between drinks
Money over matter for the rich in minks
I wouldn't ever wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Never wanna rush you
Don't want to lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you
Don't wanna lose you
I'd never fuss you
But I love a love a love you

Title: Up Where We Belong
Lyrics:
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day
Lord lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Lord lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow
Some hang on to "used to be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb them a step every day
Lord lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Lord lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know, up where the clear winds blow
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today
Lord lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Lord lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know, up where the clear winds blow
Lord lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Lord lift us up where we belong

Title: Save Tonight
Lyrics:
Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight (oh)
Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish - I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away (ohh it's true)
It ain't easy to say good-bye
Darlin' please, don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish it wasn't so
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
But girl you know I've got to go (oh)
And Lord I wish wasn't so
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow - tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Save tonight
Oh that's right
Save tonight
Save tonight

Title: Similar Features
Lyrics:
Go on and close your eyes,
Go on imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you
You never had to wait for nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been a steel blue knife
And when night after night the scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road in your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills if you can't read the signs
Go on and close your eyes, imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you
Dancing with the wall made you bitter and sweet
There ain't much you can do when they just lay it at your feet
But you could tell by the song I wanted to be the one
Did you listen again when the damage was done
Now the paint's still wet in your do-it-by-number dream
Were you gonna tell me how it felt, will you tell me what it means
Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you
Was it want with no desire?
Was it smoke with no fire?
Did I say it doesn't rip me apart... I lied
I'm sorry dear my hands are tied
Go on and close your eyes, go on imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you
Close your eyes, imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
If that's what it takes to get you through
Close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you
It shouldn't bother you
It shouldn't bother you
It shouldn't bother you
It shouldn't bother you

Title: Big Time Sensuality
Lyrics:
I can sense it
Something important,
is about to happen
It's coming up
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle,
big time sensuality
We just met,
and I know I'm a bit too intimate,
but something huge is coming up,
and we're both included
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle,
big time sensuality
I don't know my future after this weekend
and I don't want to
It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle
Big time sensuality

Title: More Than Words
Lyrics:
Saying "I love you"
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew how easy
It would be to show me how you feel
More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying "I love you"
More than words
Now but I've tried to talk to you
And make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands
And touch me
Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
When you couldn't make things new
Just by saying "I love you"
More than words
More than words
More than words
More than words
More than words

Lyrics:
hey hey
when everything goes wrong
sometimes it makes no sense
hey hey
there once was a time
I should have known better then
hey hey
although you may try
it won't come your way again
hey little girl
where will you hide
who can you run to now
hey little girl
where will you go
who can you turn to now
hey hey
so why should I care
if somebody let you down
hey hey

I know just what that can mean
hey hey
well the way that they talk
the talk is all over town
hey hey
and it's no surprise
little girls hurt sometimes

Title: Knowing Me Knowing You
Lyrics:
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
Memories, good days, bad days
They'll be, with me always
In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Title: What About Me
Lyrics:
Well, there's a little boy waiting
at the counter of the corner shop
He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day,
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground,
He gets to his feet and he says...
What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give
Well, there's a pretty girl serving
at the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream
Her dreams walk in and out; they never stop
Well she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams...
What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give
More than you give...
Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young,
but they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
"What about me?"
And now I'm standing on the corner,
all the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more, than I've got...
What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more...
What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more, you just take more
You just take more than you give
What about me?
What about me?
What about... me?

It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back, let me get it back
Mmm baby, where I come from
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has
It's been a long time since the book of love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back, carry me back
Mmm baby, where I come from, whoa whoa
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, it seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Makin' vows that just couldn't work right
Haw yeah, open your arms, open your arms, open your arms
Baby, let my love come running in, yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Ooh yeah, ooh ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Title: No Rain
Lyrics:
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane
It's not sane
I just want someone to say to me, oh oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah yeah
Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape, escape, escape
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view and I'm insane
It's not sane, it's not sane
I just want someone to say to me, oh oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah yeah
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made
I'll have it made
And I'll have it made
Oh no no
You know we're really gonna, really gonna have it made
Gonna have it made

Title: Champagne Supernova
Lyrics:
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why?
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova
'Cos people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova
'Cos people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
How many special people change?
How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high
We were getting high...

Title: You Got It
Lyrics:
Every time I look into your lovely eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
And I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Anything you want
(You got it)
Anything you need
(You got it)
Anything at all
(You got it)
And I'm glad to give my love to you
I know you feel the way I do
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Anything at all
(You got it)
Baby, you got it.

Title: Six Months In A Leaky Boat
Lyrics:
When I was a young boy
I wanted to sail around the world
That's the life for me
Living on the sea
Spirit of a sailor
Circumnavigates the globe
The lust of a pioneer
Will acknowledge no frontier
I remember you by, thunderclap in the sky
Lightning flash, tempers flare
'Round the horn if you dare
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Lucky just to keep afloat
Aotearoa
Rugged individual
Glisten like a pearl
At the bottom of the world
The tyranny of distance
Didn't stop the cavalier
So why should it stop me
I'll conquer and stay free
Ah, c'mon all you lads
Let's forget and forgive
There's a world to explore
Tales to tell back on shore
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Six months in a leaky boat
Ship-wrecked love can be cruel
Don't be fooled by her kind
There's a wind in my sails
Will protect and prevail
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
Nothing to it leaky boat

Title: Why Does It Always Rain On Me
Lyrics:
I can't sleep tonight
Everybody's saying everything is alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
Sunny days
Where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
I can't stand myself
I'm being held up by invisible men
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else
Sunny days
Oh where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Oh where did the blue sky go?
Why is it raining so?
It's so cold
I can't sleep tonight
Everybody's saying everything is alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
Sunny days
Oh where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong
Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Oh where did the blue sky go?
And why is it raining so?
It's so cold
Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Why does it always rain on me?
Why does it always rain on... on

Title: Suicide Blonde
Lyrics:
Don't you know what you're doing?
You got a death wish
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde was the color of her hair
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair
She knew it would finish before it began
Someting tells me you lost the plan
You want to make her Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde
You want to make her
Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde
She stripped to the beat But her clothes stay on
White light everywhere But you can't see a thing
Such a squeeze
A mad sad moment
Glory to you
Glory to you
Take me there
Take me there
Got some revelation
Put into your hands
Save you from your misery
Like rain across the land
Don't you see
The color of deception
Turning your world around again
You want to make her Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde
You want to make her Suicide blonde
Love devastation
Suicide blonde

Title: Dancing On The Ceiling
Lyrics:
What is happening here
Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party
It's starting tonight
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' a climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Come on!
Everybody start to lose control
When the music is right
If you see somebody hangin' around
Don't get uptight
The only thing we want to do tonight
Is go 'round and 'round
And turn upside down
Come on! Let's get down!
So come on! Let's get loose
Don't hold back
'Cause ain't no use
Hard to keep your feet on the ground
'Cause when we like to party
We only want to get down
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
(Scream, whistles) Say what?
Can't stop now
Just getting started
Everybody clap your hands
Come on
Everybody let's dance
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Baby, baby
We gonna dance all night
Till the broad daylight
Keep on movin', keep on groovin'
Oh yeah
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
(Begin fade)
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling...

Title: These Days
Lyrics:
It's coming round again
slowly creeping hand
of time and its command
soon enough it comes
and settles in its place
its shadow in my face
puts pressure in my day
This life well it's slipping right through my hands
these days turned out nothing like I had planned
It's coming round again
the slowly creeping hand
of time and its command
it settles in its place
its shadow in my face
puts pressure in my day
soon enough it comes
here it is again
slowly creeping hand
time and it's command
soon enough it comes
settles in it's place
puts pressure in my day
undignified and lame
This life well it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control well it's slipping right through my hands
these days turned out nothing like I had planned
Soon enough it comes
soon enough it comes
too tie us down
It's coming round again
Slow... slowly creeping hand
This life well it's slipping right through my hand
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control well it's slipping right through my hand
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Title: Love Rears Its Ugly Head
Lyrics:
Yeah ehh ehh
Ah oooh ooh
Dib um dib dib dib dib dib dib
I always thought that our relationship was good
You played the role of having sense
I always played the fool
Now something's different
I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate
I almost want to cry
Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
And when I come home late you don't complain or call
so as a consequence I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened
They don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me
And now my mind is gone
Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
...its ugly head
Love's not so bad they say
but you never know where love is gonna go
Does anybody really know oh?
(Check this out...)
I'm standing at the altar
As they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
She looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat
Oh no, no, no, no
Not that again... yeah...
I'm not goin'
I'm not goin when
Love rears up its ugly head
No not me
No no not me when
Love rears up its
Love rears up its ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly head
What you gonna do
What you gonna do when it comes and gets you?

Lyrics:
Now, here you go again
You say, you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully, to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
Oh, thunder, only happens when it's raining
Players, only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now, here I go again, I see
The crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me, who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering, what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost
Thunder, only happens when it's raining
Players, only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder, only happens when it's raining
Players, only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know

Title: We Belong
Lyrics:
Many times I've tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back
When you say
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together
We belong

Title: Free Your Mind
Lyrics:
Prejudice, wrote a song about it?
Like to hear? Here it goes
Free your mind
I wear tight clothing, high heel shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute (no, no, no)
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope (no, no, no)
Oh my, forgive me for having straight hair
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heirs
I might date another race or color
It doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me
(I said)
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
So I'm a sista
Buy things with cash
That really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad (Oh)
So why dispute me and waste my time
Because you really think the price is high for me
I can't look without being watched
You rang my buy before I made up my mind
Oh now attitude why even bother
I can't change your mind, can't change my color
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me
(I said)
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me
(I said)
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be color-blind, don't be so shallow

Title: The Scientist
Lyrics:
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

Title: Maggie May
Lyrics:
Wake up Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
it's late September and I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused
but I feel I'm being used
oh
Maggie
I couldn't have tried anymore.
You led me away from home
just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts.
The morning sun
when it's in your face
really shows your age
but that don't worry me none
in my eyes you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes
my love you didn't need to coax
oh
Maggie
I couldn't have tried anymore.
You led me away from home
just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul
that's a pain I can do without.
All I needed was a friend, to lend, a guiding hand
but you turned into a lover
and
Mother
what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed
and in the morning kick me in the head
oh
Maggie
I couldn't have tried anymore.
You led me away from home
'cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart
I couldn't leave you if I tried.
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock and roll band, that needs a helpin' hand.
Oh
Maggie
I wish I'd never seen your face.
you made a first-class fool out of me
but I'm as blind as a fool can be
you stole my heart but I love you anyway.
Maggie
I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home, one of these days

Title: Fields Of Gold
Lyrics:
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in fields of gold
So she took her love
For to gaze a while
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold
Will you stay with me?
Will you be my love?
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold
Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold

Title: Send Me An Angel
Lyrics:
Do you believe in heaven above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie don't be false and untrue
It all comes back to you
Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own
If a girl walks in and carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now
Empty dreams can only dissapoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up,
Don't give up
You can be lucky in love
It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now

Title: Stay (I Missed You)
Lyrics:
You say I only hear what I want to.
You say I talk so all the time so.
And I thought what I felt was simple
and I thought that I don't belong
and now that I am leaving
now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I missed you.
Yeah yeah, I missed you.
And you say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard
don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no.
So I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
lover's in love, and the other's run away
lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay.
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
dying since the day they were born.
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown.
And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure. You try to tell me that
I'm clever
but that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you.
You said that I was naive
and I thought that I was strong.
I thought, "hey, I can leave, I can leave."
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you.
Yeah, I miss you.
You said, "I caught you 'cause I want you and one day I'll let you go.
"You try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to
lose.
And you say, "Stay."
And you say I only hear what I want to

Title: Centerfold
Lyrics:
Come on
Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain
Years go by I'm lookin' through
A girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in between
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
(My blood runs cold)
Ooh My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
(Aah)
Before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes
(Aah)
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
(Aah)
When angel passed close by
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much
(My blood runs cold)
Yeah my memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
(My blood runs cold)
My memory has just been sold
Oh yeah, angel is the centerfold
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Now listen
It's okay I understand
This ain't no never never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take you car, yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it
(My blood runs cold)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
(My blood runs cold)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)
Na na na na na na na na na
Alright alright
One two three four
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Ho my blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

Title: She Works Hard For The Money
Lyrics:
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Onetta there in the corner stand
And she wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything
Nine a.m. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
Just wait for her clientele
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
Just to hear them say that they care
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Already knows
She's seen her bad times
Already knows
These are the good times
Never sell out
She never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works hard
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
Hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right, alright
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works so hard for the money
So you better treat her right, alright
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Title: It Had To Be You
Lyrics:
It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around, and finally found - the somebody who
Could make me be true, and could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad - thinking of you
Some others I've seen, might never be mean
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do - For nobody else, gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, It had to be you
(instrumental trio)
Some others I've seen, might never be mean
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do - For nobody else, gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you

Title: To The Moon And Back
Lyrics:
She's taking her time making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles
And the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(and she'll say to him)
She's saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
Ooh-ooh
She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind
All her friends they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and
push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream)
Just saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come
(And she'll say to him)
She's saying
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
yeah

I left my heart back in the Orient
Down on Bali bays
It's not the way that I should feel
But it's the way I'm gonna stay

It seems all wrong to be back home
There's no end in sight
Should I be made to drag you through
This lovers and spite
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started
Yeah
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really start
Downhearted
Broken dreams that never really started

Broken dreams that never really start
I sometimes think that we should stay
Happy on the farm
I sometimes think I'll give it all away
This love and all it's charms

Yeah

Title: Vertigo
Lyrics:
Uno, dos, tres, catorce
Turn it up loud, captain
Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head, can't rule your heart
A feeling's so much stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide and though your soul, it can't be bought
Your mind can wander
Hello, hello (hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (dónde está!)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel, feel!
The night is full of holes
'Cause bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance, at least they know
I can't stand the beat, I'm asking for the check
Girl with crimson nails has Jesus around her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music (whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Hello, hello (hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (dónde está!)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something
I can feel, feel!
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no one gets hurt
Hello, hello (hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (dónde está!)
Lights go down, and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel

Title: Shout
Lyrics:
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to...
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to...
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Title: Somebody To Love
Lyrics:
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'till I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord somebody, somebody
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?
(He works hard)
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Lord, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love?)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love love love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody somebody somebody somebody
Somebody find me
Somebody find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me somebody, somebody
(Find me somebody to love) somebody, somebody to love
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me
Somebody to love (Find me somebody to love)
(Find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love love love!
Find me, find me, find me love

Title: Locomotion
Lyrics:
Everybody's doin' a brand new dance now
(Come on baby do the locomotion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby do the locomotion)
My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your A B C's
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby, jump up, jump back
Well, I think you got the knack, ohh
Now that you can do it, let's make a chain now
(Come on baby do the locomotion)
Chug-a chug-a motion like a railway train now
(Come on baby do the locomotion)
Do it nice and easy now don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me
Come on, do the locomotion
Come on, do the locomotion
Come on, do the locomotion
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Move around the floor in a locomotion
(Come on baby do the locomotion)
Do it holding hands if you got the notion
(Come on baby do the loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby, jump up, jump back
Well, I think you got the knack, ohh
Do the loc, do the loc, do the loco locomotion
(Come on do the locomotion)
Do the loc, do the loc, do the loco locomotion
(Come on, do the locomotion)
Come on baby
All that you can do is come on baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on...
Come on!

Title: Sultans Of Swing
Lyrics:
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town
You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing
And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole
And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
"We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"

Title: Everlasting Love
Lyrics:
Hearts gone astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away, just when you, you need me so
You won't regret, I'll come back begging you
Won't you forget, welcome love we once knew
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, want to be your bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
(Real love to last forever)
(Real love to last forever)
Where life really flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun it shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine, with eternal love
Whenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own, everlasting love
(Real love to last forever)
(Real love to last forever)
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, want to be your bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
Whenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own, everlasting love

Lyrics:
There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
That people from bad homes
Do again and again
It's big and it's bland
Full of tension and fear
They do it over there
But we don't do it here
Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me

There's a brand new talk
But it's not very clear, oo, bop
That people from good homes
Are talking this year, oo, bop, fashion
It's loud and it's tasteless
I've not heard it before, oo, bop
You shout it while you're dancing
On the dance floor, oo, bop, fashion
Fashion, turn to the left

We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Listen to me, don't listen to me

Title: All That She Wants
Lyrics:
She leads a lonely life...
she leads a lonely life.
When she woke up late
in the morning light
and the day had just begun...
She opened up
her eyes and thought
oh, what a morning.
It's not a day for work,
it's a day for catching tan
just laying on the beach
and having fun
she's going to get you.
All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
is another baby, yeah.
All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
is another baby, yeah.
All that she wants...
all that she wants.
So if you are in sight
and the day is right
she's a hunter, you're the fox...
The gentle voice
that talks to you
won't talk forever.
It's a night for passion
but the morning
means goodbye...
Beware of what is flashing
in her eyes
she's going to get you.
All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
is another baby, yeah.
All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
is another baby, yeah.
All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
is another baby, yeah.
All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
is another baby, yeah.
All that she wants...
all that she wants.

While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen

Sorry you didn't see him

Oh, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive

'Cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where
Now, I can't see, I just stare

Title: Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)
Lyrics:
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
He decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Just cried my tears, for three good years
You can't be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Got me tighter in my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn and now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you own
If you don't, you'll be alone and like a ghost I'll be gone
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, now put your hands up
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it

Title: You Get What You Give
Lyrics:
Ooh
(cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha)
What, what, what, what
1, 2...
1, 2, 3, OW!
Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Age 14, they got you down on your knees
So polite, we're busy still saying please
Frienemies
Who when you're down, ain't your friend
Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry
But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (Light)
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight
You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give
I'm comin' home, baby
You're the tops
Give it to me now
Four A.M. we ran the Miracle Mile
We're flat broke, but, hey, we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial
Ha-ha-ha
But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (Friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend
You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give
This whole damn world can fall apart
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine
You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give
Don't let go
I feel the music in you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
Don't give up
Just don't be afraid to leave
Health insurance ripoff lying
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your ass in
Don't let go
One dance left
Don't give up
Can't forget
Don't let go

Title: Intergalactic
Lyrics:
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Another dimension, another dimension
Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile, I said
It always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child"
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon to the very last mile
Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile (guile)
To step to me, I'm a rapophile
If you wanna battle, you're in denial
Comin' from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead; put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile
Jazz and AWOL, that's our team
Step into the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
Well, I gotta keep it goin', keep it goin' full steam
Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme
Mario C likes to keep it clean (clean)
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping 'cause that's my dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Now when it comes to envy, ya'll is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary
We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop (wop)
Also known for the Flinstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop (crop)
Beastie Boys known to let the beat
"MMM, Drop!"
Do it
Now when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beat is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm a lumberjack, DJ Adrock
If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

Title: Sisters Are Doin It For Themselves
Lyrics:
Now there was a time
When they used to say
That behind every great man
There had to be a great woman
But in these times of change
You know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you, we say
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells, we say
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Now this is a song
To celebrate
The conscious liberation
Of the female state
Mothers, daughters
And their daughters too
Woman to woman
We're singin' with you
The inferior sex
Got a new exterior
We got doctors
Lawyers, politicians too
Everybody take a look around
Can you see, can you see
Can you see there's a woman
Right next to you, we say
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Now we ain't makin' stories
Oh, we ain't layin' plans
Don't you know that a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
Just the same way
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
There was a time
When they used to say
That behind every great man
There had to be a great woman
But in these times of change
You know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you, we say
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Sisters are doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it
Sisters are doin' it for themselves, yeah
Sisters are doin' it for themselves, yeah

Title: Vienna
Lyrics:
We walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until
The feeling has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
The music is weaving
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool, empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance
The image has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
This means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

Title: Express Yourself
Lyrics:
Baby
B-b-b-baby
Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last no-no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-hey
So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-hey
So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself
Hey-hey
(so if you want it right now)
(then make him show you how)
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not
Express yourself
(self-self-self)

Title: Fall At Your Feet
Lyrics:
I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
I think that I'm beginning to know her
Let it go
I'll be there when you call
And whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
The words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Know
I'll be waiting when you call
Hey, whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help?
Who knows where that might lead
I fall
Whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain
Whenever I fall (at your feet)
Whenever I fall

Title: Age Of Reason
Lyrics:
From the day that we were born we've been heading down a track
Sometimes it's made for good sometimes for bad
But if we look behind us there's a wave coming down
Carrying us forward to a new age
What about the world around us
How can we fail to see
And now that our fathers have gone
And we've been left to carry on
What about the age of reason
So why can't we be still why can't we love each other
Is kindness an ancient skill buried by our blindness
And if we look behind us there's a wind blowing in
To create the age of reason
If we consider carefully the options put before us
So much wisdom so much love so much waiting for us
And if we look ahead there's the sun and the seasons
Another day another age of reason

Title: Run To You
Lyrics:
She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I
Oh - but her love is cold
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause...
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you
She's got a heart of gold she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on
You keep me comin' 'round
I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you
I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch
I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night
I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Oh when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you
Oh I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night
I'm gonna run to you
Oh I'm gonna run to you
Ya - when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night
Oh when the feelin's right now
Oh when the feelin's right now
I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Ya now
Oh I'm gonna run to you, run to you
Baby gonna run to you

Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never seen
We can sail, we can sail
With the Orinoco Flow
We can sail, we can sail

We can steer, we can near
With Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say goodbye
Ross and his dependencies
We can sail, we can sail

Title: I Want It All
Lyrics:
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say
Gotta find me a future, move out of my way
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me, just give me the sign
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
I'm a man with a one track mind
So much to do in one life time
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes, I'm living it all
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
And I want it
Now
I want it
I want it

Lyrics:
Unchain my heart
Baby let me be
'Cause you don't care
Let me
Set me free
Unchain my heart
Baby let me go
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't love me no more
Every time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home
Unchain my heart

Unchain my heart
Baby let me be
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't care about me
You've got me sowed up like a mellow case
But you let my love go to waste
Unchain my heart
Set me free
I'm under your spell
Like a man in a trance baby
Oh but you're no doubt aware
That I don't stand a chance
Unchain my heart
Let me me go my way
Unchain my heart
You are in me night and day
Why leave me two a life of misery
When you don't care about the beans for me
Unchain my heart oh please
Set me free
Alright

Just like a man in a trance oh baby
But you're no doubt aware
That I don't stand a chance
Please unchain my heart
Let me go my way
Unchain my heart
Please set me free
Oh set me free
Oh woman why don't you do that for me
You don't care
Won't you let me go
That you don't love me no more
Oh
You don't care
Please set me free

Title: Amazing
Lyrics:
When all you want to do is rock,
But you don't want to bear the sock no more,
When it's just sweat that fills your eyes,
Belated feelings that you have denied.
When every wolf is at your door,
Just like a hundred times before,
But you don't want to leave the end.
Cause you were amazing,
And we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it,
Cause we were amazing things.
Rebuilding bridges in your mind,
Your eagerness now is on the line,
The plastic mountain at your feet,
Divided streets now as you look to find a seat.
When every wolf is at your door,
Just like a hundred times before,
But you don't want to see the end.
You were amazing,
And we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it,
Cause we were amazing things.
And I really didn't want that push today,
No I really didn't want to end this way,
But the things that seem to bind us,
Are the things we put behind us on this day.
Cause you were amazing,
And we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it,
Cause we were amazing things.
Cause you were amazing,
And we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it,
Cause we were amazing things.

Lyrics:
Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it
On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
It's somethin' we can't share
We cant steal it
That sweet city woman
She moved through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah
And the feelin' is right
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough
To take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark
Give you warnin'
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
And the feelin' is right
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind

Tonight it's very clear
As we're both laying here
There's so many things I wanna say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone
Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone
I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love
You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone
I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero
You've been dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together that we did it all
For the glory of love
Like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away
I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that your dreaming of
We're gonna live for ever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love
We'll live forever

Title: I Want To Know What Love Is
Lyrics:
I've gotta take a little time,
A little time to think things over.
I better read between the lines,
In case I need it when I'm older.
Now this mountain I must climb -
Feels like the world upon my shoulders.
But through the clouds I see love shine -
It keeps me warm as life grows colder.
In my life there's been heartache and pain;
I don't know if I can face it again.
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life...
I wanna know what love is.
I want you to show me.
I wanna feel what love is.
I know you can show me.
I'm gonna take a little time,
A little time to look around me.
I've got nowhere left to hide -
It looks like love has finally found me.
In my life there's been heartache and pain;
I don't know if I can face it again.
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life...
I wanna know what love is.
I want you to show me.
I wanna feel what love is.
I know you can show me.
I wanna know what love is.
I want you to show me.
(And I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is.
(And I know) I know you can show me.
(Let's talk about love) I wanna know what love is.
(Love that you feel inside) I want you to show me.
(And I'm feeling so much love) I wanna feel what love is.
(Oh no you just cannot hide) I know you can show me.
I wanna know what love is.
(Let's talk about love) I want you to show me.
(I wanna feel it) I wanna feel what love is. (I wanna feel it, too)
(And I know, and I know) I know you can show me. (Hold me back if I'm wrong)
I wanna know what love is. (I wanna know)
I want you to show me. (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
I want to feel what love is. (I wanna feel)
I know you can show me.

Title: Ship Of Fools
Lyrics:
We're setting sail
To the place on the map
From which no one has ever returned
Drawn by the promise of the joker and the fool
By the light of the crosses that burn
Drawn by the promise of the women and the lace
And the gold and the cotton and pearls
It's the place where they keep all the darkness you need
You sail away from the light of the world
On this trip, baby
You will pay tomorrow
You're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
You will pay tomorrow
Save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no
Oh, save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no
I want to run and hide
Right now
Avarice and greed
Are gonna drive you over the endless sea
They will leave you drifting in the shallows
Or drowning in the oceans of history
Traveling the world, you're in search of no good
But I'm sure you'll build your Sodom, like you knew you would
Using all the good people for your galley slaves
As your little boat struggles through the warning waves
But you don't pay
You will pay tomorrow
You're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
You gonna pay tomorrow
Save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no, no
Oh, save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no, no
Where's it coming from?
Oh, where's it going to?
It's just a
It's just a ship of fools
Here we go
All aboard

Title: No Scrubs
Lyrics:
A scrub is a guy that think he's fine and is
Also known as a buster (buster, buster)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So
No, I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
Don't want none of your time and
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
But a scrub is checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass
So (yeah, yeah)
No, I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yea son I'm talking to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (baby)
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no I don't want no (oh)
(No) no scrub
(Scrub)(no love)
(No) no scrub
(Scrub) no no
(No) no scrub
(Scrub) no no no no (no)
(Scrub) no no
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs never risin'
I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the g's
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you somethin' to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screen
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular and then I get back to ya
With diamond like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho
Not really, T-Boz and all my señoritas
Is steppin' on your Filas but you don't hear me though
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side...

Title: Owner Of A Lonely Heart
Lyrics:
Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
After my own indecision
They confused me so
(Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
(Owner of a lonely heart)
And don't you hesitate at all, no, no
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
(Owner of a lonely heart)
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start
(Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
(Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

Title: Missing
Lyrics:
I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, but you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead, of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train, I ask why did I come again?
Can I confess, I've been hanging round your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer, nothing since you've moved
You're long gone, but I can't move on
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door, I guess you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere, like outer space
You've found some better place
And I miss you,
And I miss you,
You found some better place
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain
The deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain,
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah, like the deserts miss the rain

Title: Seven Wonders
Lyrics:
Well, long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
All the way
All the way down to Emmiline
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end
...
Never
...
Never
...
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand
I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me
But if our paths never cross
Well, I'm that sorry, but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end
...
Never
...
Never
...
So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand
And you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand
If I hope
And I pray
Oooh, then it might work out someday
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(If I live to see the seven wonders)
If I live to see the seven wonders
(I'll make a path to the rainbow's end)
Well, I'll make a path, well
(I'll never live to match the beauty again)
I'll never live to see the beauty
That beauty
That same, same beauty again
(If I live to see the seven wonders)
If I live to see that
(I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again)
Oh, well, if I hope and I pray
Well, then it might work out someday
(If I live to see the seven wonders)

Title: Back For Good
Lyrics:
I guess now it's time for me to give up, I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, oh yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story, it wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Want you back, want you back
I want you back for good
Oh yeah
I guess now it's time
That you came back for good

Title: Black Or White
Lyrics:
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white

Title: Heaven
Lyrics:
Oh thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Oh once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
Now nothin' can change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
'Cause our love will light the way
And Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standin' there by you, oh!
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven, heaven
Whoa, oh, oh!
You're all that I want
You're all that I need

Title: Ordinary World
Lyrics:
Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well, now, pride's gone out the window, cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But, I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Ooh, Ahhh
Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
(Just blown away...)
And I don't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And, as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world, is my world

Title: Running Up That Hill
Lyrics:
It doesn't hurt me, do you wanna feel how it feels
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna hear about the deal I'm making
You, it's you and me
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could, oh
You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love
Oh, tell me we both matter don't we
You, it's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy
And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could, oh
You, it's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy
Come on baby, come on darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, come on, come on darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh
If I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
And be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problems
Say if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problems
Say if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
And be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problems
Say if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could, I'd be running out that hill
If I only could, I'd be running out that hill

Could you whisper in my ear
The things you wanna feel

To feel it coming
Do you wake up on your own
And wonder where you are?
You live with all your faults
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide
Don't you love the life you killed?
The priest is on the phone
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
Don't supposed I'll ever know
What it means to be a man
It's something I can't change
I'll live around it
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide
Ooh, slide
And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that fall
Oh, May
Put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful

Title: Four To The Floor
Lyrics:
With hand on heart you right from the start,
You taught me to take my part
No cross to bear
No reason to care
My life was all up in air
Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
Whenever you are near
The iron hand
Did not understand
The plight of the common man
Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
Whenever you are near
Four to the floor
I was sure
She would be my girl
We'd rent a little world
Have a little girl
Four to the floor
I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here
Four to the floor
I was sure
She would be my girl
We'd rent a little world
Have a little girl

Title: Lonely No More
Lyrics:
Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
Words are only words
Can you show me something else
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
Now its hard for me with my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything; just to get you back again
Why can we just try
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
What if I was good to you, what if you were good to me
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me
What if it was paradise, what if we were symphonies
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore
I don't wanna be lonely anymore

Title: Come Undone
Lyrics:
So unimpressed but so in awe
Such a saint but such a whore
So self aware so full of shit
So indecisive so adamant
I'm contemplating thinking about thinking
It's so frustrating just get another drink in
Watch me come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
Pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone
So rock and roll so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well trained, so animal
So need your love, so fuck you all
I'm not scared of dying I just don't want to
If I stopped lying I'd just disappoint you
I come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I've come undone
So write another ballad
Mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday
Buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song
A love song
Do another interview
Sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs
We sing love songs
So sincere
So sincere
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
Pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
I'm your son
I've come undone
I've come undone
I've come undone
I've come undone
I am scum
Love your son
I am scum
Love your son
You've gotta love my sad song, my love song
My sad song, my love song, my sad song, my love song

Title: Our House
Lyrics:
Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep
He can't hang around
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our
Our house it has a crowd
There's always something happening
And it's usually quite loud
Our mum she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down
And a mess is not allowed
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our ...
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our ...
Father gets up late for work
Mother has to iron his shirt
Then she sends the kids to school
Sees them off with a small kiss
She's the one they're going to miss
In lots of ways
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our ...
I remember way back then when everything was true and when
We would have such a very good time such a fine time
Such a happy time
And I remember how we'd play simply waste the day away
Then we'd say nothing would come between us two dreamers
Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep
Brother's got a date to keep
He can't hang around
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our ...
Our house, was our castle and our keep
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, that was where we used to sleep
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our street

Title: Better The Devil You Know
Lyrics:
Better the devil you know
Better the devil you know
Better the devil you know
Better the devil you know
Say you won't leave me no more
I'll take you back again
No more excuses no, no
'Cos I've heard them all before
A hundred times or more
I'll forgive and forget
If you say, you'll never go
'Cos it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know
Our love wasn't perfect, I know
I think, I know the score
You say you love me, oh boy
I can't ask for more
I'll come if you should call
I'll forgive and forget
If you say, you'll never go
'Cos it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know
I'll be here every day
Waitin' for your love to show
Yes, it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know
I'll take you back
I'll take you back again
I'll take you back
I'll take you back again
Say you won't leave me no more
I'll take you back again
No more excuses no, no
'Cos I've heard them all before
A hundred times or more
I'll forgive and forget
If you say, you'll never go
'Cos it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know
I'll be here every day
Waitin' for your love to show
Yes, it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know
I'll forgive and forget
If you say, you'll never go
'Cos it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know

Title: Cherry Pie
Lyrics:
Dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin...
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good makes a grown man cry
Sweet Cherry Pie
Swingin' on the front porch
Swingin' on the lawn
Swingin' where we want
'Cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left
And swingin' to the right
If I think about baseball
I'll swing all night yea
Swingin' in the living room
Swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause
They're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause
She wanted me to feed her
So I mixed up the batter
And she licked the beater
I scream you scream
We all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause
You can't ignore her
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie oh yea
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie
Swingin' to the drums
Swingin' to guitar
Swingin' to the bass
In the back of my car
Ain't got money
Ain't got no gas
But we'll get where
We're goin' if we
Swing real fast
I scream you scream
We all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause
You can't ignore her

Swingin' on the floor
Swingin' so hard
We forgot to lock the door
In walks her daddy
Standin' six foot four
He said you ain't gonna swing
With my daughter no more

Cool drink of water

Tastes so good

Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye

Title: Who Do You Think You Are
Lyrics:
The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good as long as you're getting
What's driving you? It's ambition and betting
I said who do you think you are? (Do you think are)
I said "whooo?"
Some kind of superstar
You have got to
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show how good you are
You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar, you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Climbing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong
I said who do you think you are? (Do you think are)
I said "who?"
Some kind of superstar
You have got to
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show how good you are
You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control
I said who do you think you are? (Do you think are)
I said "who?"
Some kind of superstar
You have got to
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
Who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
Show how good you are
Swing it (swing), shake it (shake), move it (move it), make it (make it)
Who do you think you are?

Title: Bust A Move
Lyrics:
This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us.
Get shot down 'cause you're overzealous,
Play hard to get, females get jealous.
OK smarty, go to a party,
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body.
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her,
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter.
Next day's function, high class luncheon,
Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'.
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin',
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'.
Says she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.
(vocal scatting)
Just bust a move!
You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope,
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope.
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theatre gets dark just to start the show
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!"
You run over there without a second to lose,
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it.
In the city, ladies look pretty.
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.
Tell a funny joke just to get some play,
Then you try to make a move and she says, "no way."
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin',
They want a man who brings home the bacon.
Got no money and you got no car,
Then you got no woman and there you are.
Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic.
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man.
So on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin',
Everything you have is yours and not stolen.
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove,
So don't just stand there, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas)
(vocal scatting)
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry,
In five days from now he's gonna marry.
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can,
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man.
You say neato, check your libido,
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.
The bride walks down just to start the wedding,
And there's one more girl you won't be getting.
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'.
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'.
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back,
And now you're feelin really fine 'cause the girl is stacked.
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin',
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'.
Says she wants to dance to a different groove.
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it.
If you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy)
(vocal scatting)

Lyrics:
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothin' 'cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare
Intangible (ah y'all) I bet you didn't think so
I command you to, panoramic view (you)
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kicking tunes
Picture you getting down and I'll picture too
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional, mystical - maybe
Spiritual hero who appears on you to clear your view
When you're too crazy
Lifeless for whose definition is for what life is
Priceless to you because I put ya on the hype shift
Did ya like it?
Gut smokin' righteous but one talkin' psychic
But among knows possess you with one though
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
(That's right)
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
The essence, the basics without it you make it
Allow me to make this child like a nature
Rhythm you have it or you don't
That's a fallacy, I'm in them
Every spiralling tree, every child of peace
Every cloud I see you see with your eyes
You see destruction and demise
(That's right)
Corruption in the skies
From this fucking enterprise that I'm sucked into your lies
The Russell that is muscles
The percussion he provides
For me I say God, y'all can see me now
'Cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the end of it
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rounds of motherfuckers
Remember but the thought is
I brought all this so you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Fearless, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future
It's coming on, it's coming on, it's coming on
My future

Title: I Knew I Loved You
Lyrics:
Hmm ohh
Maybe it's intuition
Somethings you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy but I believe
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
There's just no rhyme or reason
Only a sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for, I think I've found my way home
I know that it might sound
More than a little crazy but I believe
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
(Ooh hoo ooo, hoo hoo ooo ooh)
A thousand angels dance around you
(Ooh hoo, hoo ooo hoo ooo hoo hoo hoo)
I am complete now that I have found you
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life
I knew I loved you before I met you, I knew I loved you (Ooh hoo ooo, hoo hoo ooo)
I knew I loved you before I met you, I knew I loved you (Ooh hoo ooo, hoo hoo hoo)
I knew I loved you before I met you (Oh oh, ohh ohh, oh oh oh ay ay yea oh)
I knew I loved you before I met you, I knew I loved you
I knew I loved you before I met you

Title: Heaven Is A Place On Earth
Lyrics:
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
When the night falls down
I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside
When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinnin' with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
When I feel alone
I reach for you and you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice and it carries me
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

Title: Waiting For Tonight
Lyrics:
Like a movie scene
in the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
on my fingertips, have to say is even better.
Then I never thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life...
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight.
Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never.
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever.
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on...
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight.
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed.
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on...
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight (tonight, tonight) oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight tonight, tonight), oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight (tonight, tonight) oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight (tonight, tonight), oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight.

Title: Beautiful
Lyrics:
Don't look at me
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe.
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed.
I am beautiful no matter what they say.
Words can't bring me down.
I am beautiful in every single way.
Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no.
So don't you bring me down today.
To all your friends you're delirious,
So consumed in all your doom.
Trying hard to fill the emptiness.
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone.
is that the way it is?
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down....oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today...
No matter what we do
(no matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go
(and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
(the sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side
We are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no
So don't you bring me down today
Oh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh
Don't you bring me down ooh... today

Title: Always On My Mind
Lyrics:
Maybe I didn't treat you
quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
quite as often as I could
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second-best
I'm so sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
satisfied
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't treat you
quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you
quite as often as I could
Maybe I didn't hold you
all those lonely, lonely times
and I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Maybe I didn't love you

Title: Drops Of Jupiter
Lyrics:
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself out there
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself?
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star?
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there

Title: Hot In The City
Lyrics:
(Stranger, stranger, stranger, stranger)
It's hot here at night, lonely, black and quiet
On a hot summer night
Don't be afraid of the world we made
On a hot summer night
'Cause when a long-legged lovely walks by
Yeah you can see the look in her eye
Then you know that it's
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
(Stranger, stranger)
For all the dreams and schemes,
people are as they seem
On a hot summer night
Don't be no fun, don't forget you're young
On a hot summer night
A sometime someone you're not
Don't wait to see what you've got
'Cause you know that you're
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
We'll walk until my feet drop
I'm a train when I'm hateful
Yeah, lay right down now
And ride until your head breaks
I'm a-walkin' 'til my brain pops
I will move with the beat now
I'm a chain 'round an A-bomb
I'm a ribbon in the heat now
New York!
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight

Title: China Girl
Lyrics:
Oh, little China girl
Oh, little China girl
I couldn't escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing
I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing down
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
"Oh, baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says "sh"
She says "sh"
She says
She says
Oh, little China girl
Oh, little China girl

Title: Hey Jealousy
Lyrics:
Tell me do you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
And you can trust me not to drink
And not to sleep around
If you don't expect too much from me
You might not be let down
Cause all I really want is to be with you
Feeling like I matter too
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might be here with you
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Tell me do you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
She took my heart
Well there's only one thing I couldn't start

Title: Chemical Heart
Lyrics:
When,
look for a ride and you need to get high my friends.
spend all your time just a walkin around instead,
like black rose its somebody to hold for them,
for them.
lets,
go outside have nothin to hide for free.
can't seem to see the forrest from the trees,
grass is always greener but how do you know we'll see,
we'll see.
can't get started,
chemical heart.
everytime i get started,
you pull me apart.
can't get started,
chemical heart.
everytime i get started,
you pull me apart.
forgotton,
maybe things are right on the other side undone.
better off wishin for the stars to kill the sun,
like packed rows that nobody can hold no one, no one
cant get started,
chemical heart.
everytime i get started,
you pull me apart.
can't get started,
chemical heart.
everytime i get started,
you pull me apart.
yeah!

When,

spend all your time just a walkin around instead,

you pull me apart.
can't get started,
chemical heart.

Title: Good Thing
Lyrics:
The one good thing in my life
Has gone away
I don't know why
She's gone away
I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her
The one good thing didn't stay too long
Woo who who who
My back was turned and she was gone
Hey hey hey
Good thing
Where have you gone
Doo doo doobie doo
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow
Don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime
That's not what I want to hear
Woo who who who
I want to hear she wants me near
Good thing
Where have you gone
Doo doo doobie doo
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
Good thing
Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't act
Morning came
Hey hey hey heyInto my room
Woo who who who
Caught me dreaming like a fool
Good thing
My good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
My my my my my good thing
Where have you gone
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo

Title: Ice Ice Baby
Lyrics:
Yo VIP, let's kick it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
"Did you stop?" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
Take heed cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this. Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say "Damn!"
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
Yo man let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
Ice ice baby

Title: Viva La Vida
Lyrics:
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Title: Amazing
Lyrics:
I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix
Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby'
Still missing my baby...
I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady?
Maybe luck is a lady
I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing,
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
You tried to save me from myself
Said 'Darling, kiss as many as you want!
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable'
We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom
And your mom ...was always acting crazy
I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I thought that loving you
was out of the question
Then I saw my reflection
Saying please don't let this go
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing,
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
Celebrate the love of the one you're with
Celebrate, this life with you baby
I think you should celebrate yeah
Don't put your love in chains baby
No no, walk in the midday sun
I thought I was dreaming
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with
As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up...

Title: Californication
Lyrics:
Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication
It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it's settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin?
Or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off "Station to Station"?
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Title: Hollywood Nights
Lyrics:
She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
He was too far from home
She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed
And those Hollywood night
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
All those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of the skills
He'd headed west 'cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control
Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA
Wondering if he could ever go home
And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
It was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills
In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
All those big city lights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of the skills

Title: I Heard A Rumour
Lyrics:
Who needs friends who never show
I'll tell you what you wanna know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about those lonely nights
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out all my friends were right, oh, oh
I didn't know you at all
I heard a rumour
Oh, oh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Oh, oh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, oh
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
Baby, I'm too afraid
So you realize what hurt you made
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
I heard a rumour
Oh, oh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Oh, oh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, oh
I heard a rumour
Oh, oh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Oh, oh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, oh
I'm just thinking about those lonely nights
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out all my friends were right, oh, oh

Lyrics:
Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching
All the commotion
The kiddie like play
Has people talking
They're talking
You, Your sex is on fire
Dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying
You, Your sex is on fire
Consumed,
With the what's to transpire
Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
But it's not forever
But it's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest
You, Your sex is on fire
You, Your sex is on fire
Consumed,
With the what's to transpire
And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed,
With the what's to transpire

Title: Greatest Love Of All
Lyrics:
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone
Who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me.
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe.
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
And If by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love.

Lyrics:
Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what i choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you
Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you

Lyrics:
I saw werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
For to get a big dish of beef chow mein
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
You hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Hunh
(solo)
He's the hairy-handed gent
Who ran amok in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim
Hunh, I'd like to meet his tailor
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen
Doin' the werewolves of London
I saw Lon Chaney Jr. walking with the Queen
Doin' the werewolves of London
I saw a werewolf drinkin' a piña colada at Trader Vic's
His hair was perfect
Ah-hooo
Werewolves of London
Heh, draw blood
Ah-hooo
Werewolves of London

Title: Playing To Win
Lyrics:
If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm not waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
If you want me, come and say it
Don't wait around for another chance
Make your mind up, make your play
You should be playing to win this time
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
All those wasted years, didn't know I was only emotion away
I got what I wanted from me
I didn't see it was not what I needed
Well, I was a fool
This time I'm playing to win
If you want me, come and get me
You don't have a chance if you don't move now
I'm not waiting any longer
You know that I'm playing to win this time
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
When you make your move, I won't hesitate
If you take too long, you could be too late
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win
You know that I'm [Incomprehensible] to win
This time I'm playing to win
This time I'm playing to win

Title: Close To Me
Lyrics:
I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be
This close to me
Just try to see in the dark
Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out
Hold my breath
And wait until I shake...
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream
I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be
This close to me
But if I had your face
I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

Title: It Must Have Been Love
Lyrics:
It must have been love but it's over now
Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside, I turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been love but it's over now

Title: Just Like Paradise
Lyrics:
Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo with the big guitars
And that's all right
Yeah (All right)
I got the itch and a restless soul
She gone with the wind, gonna go for broke tonight, yeah
And that's (All night)
Girl, we've been meant for this since we were born (Since we were born)
No problems now, coast is clear (Ooh)
It's just the calm before the storm
This must be just like livin' in paradise (Just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (And I don't want to go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise
And I don't wanna go home
Suzy, Suzy, girl, for cryin' out loud
You got all the right moves, you make me eat my heart out
Nightly, aw (That's all right with me)
Yeah
No special favors, make it out to cash
We'll spend it later, got to make this romance last
And (Last)
That's it, that's it
Some folks say easy come is easy go (And some folks say)
But one night ain't enough for me
Girl, hang on tight and don't let go
This must be just like livin' in paradise (It's just like paradise, hey)
And I don't wanna go home (And I ain't never goin' home)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (Just like, just like paradise)
And I don't wanna go home
Whoo, this must be just like livin' in paradise (In paradise, paradise)
And I don't wanna go home (And I don't, I don't wanna go)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (Come on, ah, come on)
And I don't wanna go home (Wow, 1-800-SEE-YA, baby)
This must be just like livin' in paradise (Just like, just like)
And I don't wanna go home (Wow, hey hey)
(Just like paradise, just like) This must be just like livin' in paradise

Title: Waterloo
Lyrics:
My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo
My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo
So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo

Lyrics:
Revvin' up your engine
Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone
Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin' off the deck
And shovin' into overdrive
Highway to the Danger Zone
I'll take you right into the Danger Zone
You'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go
Out along the edges
Always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity
Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into, the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take it right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone

Twistin', turnin', we keep burnin'
Shake it high or shake it low
We take our bodies where they wanna go
Feel that beat, never stop
Oh, hold me tight, spin me like a top
Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show 'em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah

There's nothing more that I'd like to do
Than take the floor and dance with you
Keep dancin', let's keep dancin'
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Groovin' loose or heart to heart
We put in motion every single part

Title: Slave To Love
Lyrics:
Tell her I'll be waiting
In the usual place
With the tired and weary
And there's no escape
To need a woman
You've got to know
How the strong get weak
And the rich get poor
Slave to love
Slave to love
You're running with me
Don't touch the ground
We're restless hearted
Not the chained and bound
The sky is burning
A sea of flame
Though your world is changing
I will be the same
Slave to love
Slave to love
Slave to love
Slave to love
And I can't escape
I'm a slave to love
The storm is breaking
Or so it seems
We're too young to reason
Too grown up to dream
Now spring is turning
Your face to mine
I can hear your laughter
I can see your smile
Slave to love
Slave to love
And I can't escape
I'm a slave to love
Slave to love
Slave to love
And I can't escape
I'm a slave to love
Slave to love
And I can't escape
I'm a slave to love
Slave to love
And I can't escape
I'm a slave to love
Slave to love
And I can't escape
I'm a slave to love

I said upside down you're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
Around and round you're turning me
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Instinctively you give to me
The love that I need

Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
But no one makes me feel like you do
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
I know you got your mad appeal
You always play the field
I'm crazy to think you are all mine
As long as the sun continues to shine
There's a place in my heart for you
That's the bottom line
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down

Instinctively you give to me

Title: Holy Grail
Lyrics:
You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it, I still don't know why
Why I love you so much, oh
You curse my name
In spite, to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love it so much, yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from the cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail
Uh, Blue told me to remind you niggas
Uh, fuck that shit y'all talkin' about, I'm the nigga
Uh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uh, goddammit I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
'Nough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself uh
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Know we all just entertainers
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from the cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sittin' low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit ain't work, this light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours, why you mad take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with that bath water you're still alive
Still that nigga nigga, you survived
You still getting bigger nigga living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa, illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack the code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail
You get the air of my lungs, whenever you need it
And you take, the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleeding, I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And you play this game, in spite, to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink, with guess who's name
But I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Yeah
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup 'till it runneth over, Holy Grail
Don't know why

Title: Babylon
Lyrics:
Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule
Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made
If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
Sunday all the lights of London
Shining, Sky is fading red to blue
Kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me
And if you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Babylon, Babylon, Babylon

Title: We Belong Together
Lyrics:
I didn't mean it when I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
Guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here,'cause baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
"If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep(too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
"I only think of you"
And its' breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together

Title: A Groovy Kind Of Love
Lyrics:
When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue.
When you're close to me
I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear.
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We've got a groovy kind of love?
Any time you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to
Any time at all.
When I kiss your lips
Ooh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside.
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We've got a groovy kind of love?
Woah.
When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue.
When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter
I don't care.
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We've got a groovy kind of love?
We've got a groovy kind of love?
We've got a groovy kind of love?
Oho, woah.
We've got a groovy kind of love?

Title: Uptown Girl
Lyrics:
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win
And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl

Title: Pass The Dutchie
Lyrics:
This generation
Rules the nation
With version
Music happen to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub
(Dum dum ba dum biddly biddly biddly biddly bum)
I say, pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)
It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
So I left my gate and went out for a walk
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)
Dum
So I stopped to find out what was going on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know, He leads you on
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)
'Cause me say listen to the drum, a me say listen to the bass
Give me little music, make me wind up me waist
Me say listen to the drum, a me say listen to the bass
Give me little music, make me wind up me waist
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)
You play it on the radio
A so me say, we a go hear it on the stereo
A so me know we a go play it on the disco
A so me say we a go hear it on the stereo
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)

Title: Cherish
Lyrics:
Cherish, cherish
So tired of broken hearts
And losin' at this game before I start
This dance I'll take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
I was never satisfied
With casual encounters, I can't hide
My need for two hearts that bleed
With burning love that's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet
They never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
I cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
Who? You
Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You
I could never forget to
Cherish is the word
I used to remind me of your love
Keep giving it, keep giving it to me
Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy
Give me faith, I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet
They never felt this way, I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
I cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it
Cherish the strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
Cherish
Give me faith, give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you
Cherish your strength
Keep giving it, keep giving it to me
Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy
Cherish the love
Give me faith, give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you

Title: If I Could Turn Back Time
Lyrics:
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
And you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but Baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do
(If I could turn back time)
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife
And drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door
I swore that I didn't care
But I lost every thing darling then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind, and darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do, ohh
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time, ohh Baby
I didnt really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry
But ohh
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do
If I could turn back time
(Turn back time)
If I could find a way
(Find a way)
Then maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
(Reach the stars)
If I could reach the stars

Title: Who Knew
Lyrics:
You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed in everything you said to me
Yeah huh, that's right
If someone said three years from now, you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever and ever
Who knew?
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything
When someone said count your blessings now, before they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how, I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever and ever
Who knew?
I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?
If someone said three years from now, you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong and
That last kiss I'll cherish until we meet again
And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
My darling, who knew?
Who knew?

Title: Dreams
Lyrics:
They can come true
They can come true
Move a step closer
You know that I want you
I can tell by your eyes
That you want me too
Just a question of time
I knew we'd be together
And that you'd be mine
I want you here forever
Do you hear what I'm saying
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want
And baby it's you
I can't deny my feelings
Because they are true
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
I've seen you sometimes
On your own and in crowds
I knew I had to have you
My hopes didn't let me down
Now you're by my side
And I feel so good
I've nothing to hide
Don't feel that I ever could
Do you hear what I'm saying
Gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here
But I know that you're real
I know what I want
And baby it's you
Can't deny my feelings
Because they are true
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
I'm not making plans for tomorrow
Let's live for tonight
I know I want you baby
So hold me so tight
Put your arms around me
You make me feel so safe
Then you whisper in my ear
That you're here to stay
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe, I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong...

Title: Black Fingernails Red Wine
Lyrics:
Black fingernails, red wine
I wanna make you, all mine
A lot of people, underground
You wanna get there
You gotta go straight down
There's a culture, everywhere
Smoke clouds, hang in the air
It's so loud, can't hear you talk
You and I, should take a walk downtown

Straight down
Downtown
Straight down
The argument over god continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
At the ground
All of us stand and point our fingers
Straight down
Red-letter day, black heart
Its gonna tear you, all apart
It's so loud; can't hear you call
You and I, are gonna fall straight down
Straight down
Downtown
Straight down
The argument over god continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
At the ground
Argument over all continues
In this house
All of stand and point our fingers
Straight down x3
Black fingernails, red wine
I wanna make you, all mine
A lot of people, underground
You wanna get there, you gotta go straight down
The argument over god continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
At the ground
The argument over all continues
In this house
All of us stand and point our fingers
Straight down x3

Title: Frozen
Lyrics:
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open
Mmm hmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the key
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
Mmm hmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the key
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
Mmm hmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmm hmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm hmmm, give yourself to me
Mmm hmmm, you hold the key

Title: The Nips Are Getting Bigger
Lyrics:
Started out, just drinkin' beer
I didn't know how or why
Or what I was doin' there
Just a couple more
Made me feel a little better
Believe me when I tell you
It was nothin' to do with the letter
I ran right out of beer
I took a look into the larder
No bones, nothin'
I'd better go and get somethin' harder
Back in a flash
I started on a dash of Jamaica rum
Me and Pat Malone
Drinking on our ow-ow-ow-own
Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Woh-yeah, the nips are gettin' bigger
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Yeah-eah-eah, mmm they're gettin' bigger
Sometimes I wonder
What all these chemicals
Are doin' to my brain
Doesn't worry me enough
To stop me from doin' it agai-ai-ain
Wipin' out brain cells
By the millions but I don't care
It doesn't worry me
Even though
I ain't got a lot to spare-are-are
Woh-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Woh-yeah-eah, the nips are gettin' bigger
Wo-hoh-oh, the nips are gettin' bigger
Yeah-eah-eah, they're gettin' bigger

If you want my love, you got it
When you need my love, you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, ooh
If you want my love, you got it
When you need my love, you got it

A special girl in this crazy old world
You couldn't see me when I laid eyes on you
Lonely is only a place
You don't know what it's like
You can't fight it
And it's a hole in my heart, in my heart
If you want my love, you got it
When you need my love, you got it

You hold the secrets of love in this world
I'm hypnotized by your every word
A special face, a special voice, a special smile in my life
'Cause lonely is only a place
You don't know what it's like
You can't fight it
And it's a hole in my heart, in my heart
If you want my love, you got it

Lyrics:
I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was trying to catch your eye
I thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

Title: Wild Thing
Lyrics:
Let's do it
Workin' all week
9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club was jumpin'
duce myself as Loc
She said, "You're a liar"
I said, "I got it goin' on baby doll
And I'm on fire"
Took her to the hotel she said
"You're the king"
I said, "Be my queen if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing
Shoppin' at the mall
Looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said
"You have plans for the night"
I said, "Hopefully if things go
Well, I'll be with you tonight"
So we journeyed to her house
One thing led to an other
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, "Hey, you two, I was once like you
And I liked to do the wild thing"
She loved to do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please
Posse in effect
Hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig
I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine
Still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack
She was like static cling
But that's what happens
When body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please, baby, baby, please
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said, "Chill for now but maybe later, you'll get your chance"
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, "Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need Dollar 50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing"
Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

On the streets of Brazil

Come on baby it won't take long,
Only take a minute just to sing my song
Song, yeah.
Everybody shake.

Title: Valerie
Lyrics:
So wild, standing there, with her hands in her hair
I can't help remember just where she touched me
There's still no face here in her place
So cool, she was like jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet, then she just blew away
Now she can't be that warm with the wind in her arms
Valerie, call on me-call on me, Valerie
Come and see me-I'm the same boy I used to be
Love songs fill the night, but they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry out just like they're dying
Her cries hang there in time somewhere
Someday, some good wind may blow her back to me
Some night I may hear her like she used to be
No it can't be that warm with the wind in her arms
Valerie, call on me-call on me, Valerie
Come and see me-I'm the same boy I used to be
So cool, she was like jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet, then she just blew away
Now she can't be that warm with the wind in your arms
Valerie, call on me-call on me, Valerie
Come and see me-I'm the same boy I used to be

Title: All Fired Up
Lyrics:
Livin' with my eyes closed
Goin' day to day
I never knew the difference
I never cared either way
Lookin' for a reason
Searchin' for a sign
Reachin' out with both hands
I gotta feel the kick inside
All fired up (now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up (when everything just falls in line)
All fired up (we live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up
Hey!
Ain't nobody livin'
In a perfect world
Everybody's out there
Cryin' to be heard
Now I got a new fire
Burnin' in my eyes
Lightin' up the darkness
Movin' like a meteorite
All fired up (now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up (when everything just falls in line)
All fired up (we live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up (the deepest cuts are healed by faith)
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith
Now I believe
All fired up (now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up (when everything just falls in line)
All fired up (we live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up (the deepest cuts are healed by faith)
All fired up, now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line
We live and learn from our mistakes
The deepest cuts are healed by faith

Title: Unfinished Sympathy
Lyrics:
I know that I've been mad in love before
And how it could be with you
Really hurt me baby, really hurt me baby
How can you have a day without a night?
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more
The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching
Really hurt me, baby, really hurt me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part

Title: Say Goodbye To Hollywood
Lyrics:
Bobby's driving through the city tonight
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Johnny's taking care of things for a while
And his style is so right for troubadours
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Moving on is a chance that you take
Any time you try to stay together
Whoa
Say a word out of line
And you find that the friends you had
Are gone forever
Forever
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last
Some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Moving on is a chance that you take
Any time you try to stay together
Whoa
Say a word out of line
And you find that the friends you had
Are gone forever
Forever
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last
Some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby

Title: The Greatest View
Lyrics:
You're the analyst
The fungus in my milk
When you want no one
And you got someone
Through the wind you crawl
And laugh at burning dunes
When no one else will ever see
Now that you know why you feel like you do
They're turning their head whilst they wait for no one
And finally I know why you feel like letting go
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here
Mistakes don't mean a thing
If you don't regret them
So pack your tactic toes for the winter
Chain a waterfall to burned and withered skin
No one else will ever see
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here
Now that you know why you feel like you do
They're turning their head whilst they wait for no one
And finally I know why I feel like you're letting go
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here
The greatest view from here
The greatest view

Title: Little Red Corvette
Lyrics:
I guess I should've known by the way
You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last
I guess I should've closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?", Oh yeah
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes, you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey
Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down
(Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red corvette
Right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground
(Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a Limousine
Ow, baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)
Babe, you got to slow down
(Y got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)
Right into the ground
(Right into the ground)

Title: You Can Leave Your Hat On
Lyrics:
Baby take off your coat
Real slow
Take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby, take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
Go over there, turn on the lights
All the lights
Come back here, stand on that chair
Get up woman, that's right
Raise your arms up in the air
And now shake 'em
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
Sweet darling
(You can leave your hat on)
Just leave your hat on, girl
A little wild man
(You can leave your hat on)
Leave your hat on
(You can leave your hat on)
(You can leave your hat on)
Suspicious minds are talkin'
They're tryin' to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
I know what love is
And baby, put it my way
(You can leave your hat on)
And just leave your hat on now
They don't wanna
(You can leave your hat on)
Won't you do that for me, babe?
(You can leave your hat on)
And just leave your hat on, girl
(You can leave your hat on)

Title: Wanted Dead Or Alive
Lyrics:
It's all the same.
Only the names will change,
Everyday
it seems were wasting away.
Another place
where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home.
I'm a cowboy.
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted,
dead or alive.
Wanted,
dead or alive.
Somtimes I sleep,
sometimes it's not for days.
Now people like me,
must go their seperate ways.
Sometimes you'll tell the day,
by the bottle that you drink.
Sometimes when your alone,
all you do is think.
I'm a cowboy,
on a steel horse I ride.
I'm wanted (wanted),
dead or alive.
Wanted (wanted,)
dead or alive.
Oh ride
I'm a cowboy,
on a steel horse I ride.
I'm wanted (wanted),
dead or alive.
Off these streets,
a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps,
Because I might not make it back.
I've been everywhere,
standing tall
I've seen a million faces
and I've rocked them all.
'Cause I'm a cowboy,
on a steel horse I ride.
I'm wanted (wanted)
dead or alive.
'Cause I'm a cowboy,
I've got the night on my side.
I'm wanted (wanted)
dead or alive.
Alive (alive)
Dead or alive.
I still drive (I still drive)
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.
Dead or alive.

Title: Lady Marmalade
Lyrics:
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
He met Marmalade down in Old New Orleans
Struttin' her stuff on the street
She said, "Hello, hey Joe
You wanna give it a go?"
Gitchi gitchi ya ya da da
Gitchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha chocolata, ya ya
Creole Lady Marmalade
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
He stayed in her boudoir
While she freshened up
That boy drank all that Magnolia wine
On her black satin sheets
Where he started to freak
Gitchi gitchi ya ya da da
Gitchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha chocolata, ya ya
Creole Lady Marmalade
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
Hey, hey, hey
Seeing her skin, feeling silky smooth
Color of cafe au lait
Made the savage beast inside
Roaring until it cried, "More, more, more!"
Now he's at home doing 9 to 5
Living his brave life of lies
But when he turns off to sleep
All memories keep more, more, more
Gitchi gitchi ya ya da da da
Gitchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha chocolata, ya ya
Creole Lady Marmalade
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir?

Title: Smooth
Lyrics:
Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
Yea
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name callin' me out
Out from the barrio you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you say, "This life ain't good enough"
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
And just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it
Yeah

Or else forget about it

Title: Life In A Northern Town
Lyrics:
The Salvation Army band played
And the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day, all day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away, oh
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma
They sat on the stoney ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down to listen
He said in winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy
And The Beatles
Yeah, yeah
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
All the work shut down
The evening turned to rain
Watched the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down to the station
And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight... bye-bye
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Ah hey ma ma ma ma
Take it easy on yourself
Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting for you.
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do

Baby, night and day

I'm tired of waiting on you
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me
'Cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing
Every little thing

Waiting for your call

Title: Veronica
Lyrics:
Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well I used to know a girl and I would have
sworn that her name was Veronica
Well she used to have a carefree mind of her
own and a delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure if her
name is Veronica
Do you suppose, that waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those who shout
her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Did the days drag by? Did the favours wane?
Did he roam down the town all the time?
Will you wake from your dream, with a wolf at
the door, reaching out for Veronica
Well it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica
On the "Empress of India"
And as she closed her eyes upon the world and
picked upon the bones of last week's news
She spoke his name outloud again
Do you suppose, that waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those who shout
her name and steal her clothes
Veronica
Veronica
Veronica sits in her favourite chair and she sits
very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get
right and if they don't then nobody else will
But she used to have a carefree mind of her
own, with devilish look in her eye
Saying "You can call me anything you like, but
my name is Veronica"
Do you suppose, that waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those who shout
her name and steal her clothes
Veronica

Lyrics:
I look at the sunrise
I look at it burn
I look into your eyes
don't know where to turn
I'm gonna drift into that void
I'm flying through space
I'm an asteroid
I'm dancing that place
when you're paranoid
I'm thining about you and nothing else...
Think about you
you think about me
Think about you, counting
the beat
Thinking about you
Thinking about me
Thinking about just you and me
La-dah-da-dee, There's ain't no place I'd rather be
La-da-de-da la-da-de-da
la-da-de-da-de-da-de-da

I'm bleeding to death
on th cloudiest day
Three-four-five beat

I'm feeling the heat, glad to be alive
I'm couting the beat, six-

Think about you

Think about you, counting

Thinking about you
Thinking about me
Thinking about yoooou

Thinking about yoooou
Thinking about just you and me

Title: So Beautiful
Lyrics:
Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
What you're up to, where you've been,
Just thinking...
You know the clothes that you wear, and the colour in your hair,
Shouldn't change you,
Now you tell me why is it so,
You're bigger than Almighty Joe
At least you think so
God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know,
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down,
Plant your feet back on the ground
Threw my smoke down on the ground
Turned my head and I heard the sound, that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet,
Always so much fun to me
At least I thought so
Now you think you're so damn fine,
You could rule the world,
No not mine,
I don't think so
God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much, that I don't know,
If I can call you and tell you I care
know the scene that you're in,
And the people that you've been with,
Just get to me,
But you think I'm not as cool
As you are so beautiful,
Who you foolin?
Well I'm here to tell you babe,
The game you're in is just a game
So damn pretentious
God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know,
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down,
Plant your feet back on the ground
You think you're so beautiful... So beautiful

Title: Higher And Higher
Lyrics:
Your love
Lifted me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before.
So keep it up,
Quench my desire,
And I'll be at your side forevermore.
(Chorus)
You know your love (Your love keeps lifting me, your)
Keep on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and Higher (higher and higher, higher)
I said, your love (Your love keeps lifting me, your)
Keep on (love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and Higher (higher and higher, higher).
Listen:
Now once,
I was downhearted.
Disappointment was my closest friend.
But then you came,
And he soon departed,
And you know,
He never showed his face again.
(Repeat Chorus)
All right.
Ooh...
I'm so glad
I finally found you:
Yes, that one-in-a-million girl.
When I wrap my loving arms around you,
Honey,
I can stand up and face the world.
Let me tell you,
(Repeat Chorus then ad lib to fade)

Title: Chasing Cars
Lyrics:
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Title: Young Hearts Run Free
Lyrics:
What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up, just another lost and lonely wife
You count up the years, and they will be filled with tears, oooh
Love only breaks up, to start over again
You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, huh huh
Say I wanna leave a thousand times a day
It's easier said that done, when I just can't break away
Just can't break away
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me (oooh)
Hmmm, my man and me
Young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when loving is all there is (oooh)
I said I don't love you
It's high time, just one crack at life
Who we want to live in, trouble and strife
My mind must be free, to learn all I can about me
I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Caress the babies every time they say
Self resevation is what's really going on today, oooh
Say I wanna leave a thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When you just can't break away (just can't break away)
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me (oooh)
Oooh, my man and me
Whoa, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when loving is all there is (oooh)
I said I don't love you, hmmm
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me (oooh)
Whoa, my man and me
Whoa, young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool when loving is all there is (oooh)
No, yeah aaah aaah aaah
Young hearts, run free...

Title: Crazy
Lyrics:
I remember when,
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me Crazy
Does that make me Crazy
Does that make me Crazy
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now
Who do you, who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you're in control
I think you're Crazy
I think you're Crazy
I think you're Crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
All I remember is thinking I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm Crazy
Maybe you're Crazy
Maybe we're Crazy
Probably

Title: Girl U Want
Lyrics:
she sings from somewhere you can't see
she sits in the top of the greenest tree
she sends out an aroma of undefined love
it drips on down in a mist from above
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
you hear her calling everywhere you turn
you know you're headed for the pleasure burn
but the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue
she's the real thing but you knew it all along
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
look at you with your mouth watering
look at you with your mind reeling
why don't we just admit it's all over
just the girl u want
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
she sings from somewhere you can't see
she sits in the top of the greenest tree
she sends out an aroma of undefined lust
it drips on down in a mist from above
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
she's just the girl, just the girl
that u want
look at you with your mouth watering
look at you with your mind spinnin'
why don't we just admit it's all over

Title: How You Remind Me
Lyrics:
Never made it as a wise man 
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing 
Tired of living like a blind man 
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling 
And this is how you remind me 
This is how you remind me 
Of what I really am 
This is how you remind me 
Of what I really am 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waiting on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
for handing you a heart worth breaking 
and I've been wrong, i've been down, 
been to the bottom of every bottle 
these five words in my head 
scream "are we having fun yet?" 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no 
yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no 
it's not like you didn't know that 
I said I love you and I swear I still do 
And it must have been so bad 
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you 
And this is how, you remind me 
Of what I really am 
This is how, you remind me 
Of what I really am 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waiting on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
for handing you a heart worth breaking 
and I've been wrong, i've been down, 
been to the bottom of every bottle 
these five words in my head 
scream "are we having fun yet?" 
Yet, yet, yet, no, no 
yet, yet, yet, no, no 
yet, yet, yet, no, no 
yet, yet, yet, no, no 
Never made it as a wise man 
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing 
And this is how you remind me 
This is how you remind me 
This is how you remind me 
Of what i really am 
This is how you remind me 
Of what I really am 
It's not like you to say sorry 
I was waiting on a different story 
This time I'm mistaken 
for handing you a heart worth breaking 
And I've been wrong, I've been down, 
been to the bottom of every bottle 
these five words in my head 
scream "are we having fun yet?" 
Yet, yet 
are we having fun yet
Yet, yet 
are we having fun yet
Yet, yet 
are we having fun yet

Title: Not Ready To Make Nice
Lyrics:
Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting
I'm through with doubt
There's nothing left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep paying
...
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
I know you said
Can't you just get over it?
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter
Sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over
...
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should
...
Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

Title: People Everyday
Lyrics:
See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes a woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me
I am everyday people, yeah
See I am everyday people, yeah
I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see
I am everyday people, yeah
You see, I am everyday people

Lyrics:
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic Mister Know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health
'Cause with the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma and pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawling
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl
And with the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic Mister Know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Title: Woman In Love
Lyrics:
Life is a moment to space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What do I do?
With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts
We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What'do I do?
I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
You know I know how you feel
What a woman can do
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again...

Give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 and I'm calling in reference
To the music business. thank you."

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name
And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name (uh)
And your number
And I'll get back to you.
Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the day-glo
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
"i got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes
Pos:
Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Yo, check it, exit the old style
Enters the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's harry, dick, and tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, "yo black, just play me the tape"
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles kool-aid wide and ask,
"was it def? "
And with the straighest face I be like, "hell yes."
I slip them the digits to papa prince paul
So I don't go awol but yet I know when they call
They get
Mase:
Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name
And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin
Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Check it out
Party at the dug-out on diction ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, plug one mosies in
And I be like, "yo g, pos does all the producing"
Pos:
Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like luke sky
Me myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like,
"yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"
I be like "oh swell"
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem
Dove:
"hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep.
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to tru instead of fronting on the speak."
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line
Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Pos:
Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you. peace

Title: Invisible Touch
Lyrics:
Well, I've been waiting,
waiting here so long,
But thinking nothing,
nothing could go wrong,
Well, now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.
I don't really know her,
I only know her name.
But she crawls under your skin,
you're never quite the same,
and now I know
She's got something you just can't trust,
And it's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
It takes control and soon it tears you apart.
Well, she don't like losing,
to her it's still a game.
And though she'll mess up your life,
you'll want her just the same,
now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees,
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh,
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh,
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh,
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She seems to have an invisible, oh-oh-oh...

Title: I Ran
Lyrics:
I walked along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
Hypnotize me through
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away
A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away
Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I couldn't get away

Title: Raspberry Beret
Lyrics:
1 2 1 2 3 4
Yeah
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her
Built like she was
She had the nerve 2 ask me
If I planned 2 do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't 2 bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how 2 get her kicks
She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who U are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
U feel like a movie star
Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance 2 do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then
(Raspberry beret)
The kind U find (The kind U find)
The kind U find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)
I think I... I think I... I think I love her
(Raspberry beret)
No No No
No No No (The kind U find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love...

Title: Blaze Of Glory
Lyrics:
I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind
When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mister catch me if you can
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
And I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun
Solo
Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Staring down a bullet
Let me make my final stand
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
I'm a young gun

Title: The Winner Takes It All
Lyrics:
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It's so plain)
Why should I complain (Why complain)
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide (Will decide)
The likes of me abide (Me abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or)
The winner takes it all (Small)
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
And it's plain, I complain

Lyrics:
Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great.
You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?
Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
And who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?
You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?
You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothin's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
Oh, you know you can't go on, thinkin'
Nothin's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

Title: Good Fortune
Lyrics:
Threw my bad fortune
Of the top of
A tall building
I'd rather have done it with you
Your boy's smile
Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love
In chinatown
Hung over
You showed me
Just what I could do
Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
Just what it was worth
And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the
Innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say
Things I once thought
Unbelievable
In my life
Have all taken place
When we walked through
Little italy
I saw my reflection
Come right of your face
I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words
Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world
And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the
Innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say
So I take my
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving
Like some modern-day
Gypsy landslide
Like some modern day
Bonnie and clyde
On the run again
On the run again

Title: Spinning Around
Lyrics:
Spinning around
Spinning around
Ohh
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
Traded in my sorrows for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it
The mistakes I've made, have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cuz it's gotta be real
I've got nothin' left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cuz the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, gettin' rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breakin' it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feelin' me 'cause you like it like this
Feelin' me 'cause you like it like this, oh, I'm not the same
I know you like it like this, oh, ooh yeah
Like it like this, like it like this, I'm not the same
Like it like this, I'm not the same, oh

Title: Come Anytime
Lyrics:
What is it you want from me?
There isn't much I will not do
If it's only company
You know, I might need that too
Won't you
Come anytime - I'm a man of leisure
Come anytime, I await your pleasure
There's nothing new beneath the sun
We've butchered every sacred cow
Don't tell me about all the things you might have done
Just tell me what are you doing now - right now
Come anytime, I won't give you pressure
Come anytime - I can wait forever
And if you can't make up your mind
We could make it up together
Things like this happen every day
Whatever happens, it's O. K
Why be afraid when we've got it made -
I'll never ask you to explain
What is it you want from me?
You won't shock me easily
Maybe it's your heart's desire
Maybe it's your wildest dream
Maybe I'm a gun-for-hire but
Baby, don't we make quite a team, Don't we?
Don't we?
Come anytime (you're so inclined) I won't give you trouble
Come anytime (you're going blind) or you're seeing double
And I have never been the kind who'd want to
Burst your bubble
Come anytime

Lyrics:
Joey...
Baby...
Don't get crazy
Detours, fences...
I get defensive...
I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and let you
Fight your secret war
And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh Joey if you're hurting so am I
Joey...
Honey...
I've got the money
All is forgiven. 
Listen... listen...
But if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you
Well, I guess you scared me too
But we got lucky once before
And I don't want to close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
Passed out on the floor...
Oh...
Joey, I'm not angry anymore
And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you
Well I guess you scared me too...
But if it's love you're looking for
Then I can give a little more
And if you're somewhere drunk and
Passed out on the floor...
Oh...
Joey, I'm not angry anymore
Angry anymore, angry anymore

Lyrics:
Kick it!
You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask you mom, "Please?", but she still says, "No"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
You gotta fight for your right to party
You pop caught you smoking, and he said, "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
(Busted)
You gotta fight for your right to party
You pop caught you smoking, and he said, "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
(Busted)
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, "What's that noise?"
Aw, mom you're just jealous, it's the Beastie Boys
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party

Title: Just Like A Pill
Lyrics:
I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me
I think, I took too much
I'm cryin' here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun
I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch
I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills, they were different
Maybe I should get some help
I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch
I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here, where I can
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
I can't stay on your life support, there's a shortage in the switch

I can't stay on your morphine, 'cuz its makin' me itch

I said, I tried to call the nurse again but she's being a little bitch

I think I'll get outta here, where I can
Run just as fast as I can

To the middle of my frustrated fears
(Frustrated, frustrated fears)
And I swear you're just like a pill
Instead of makin' me better, you keep makin' me ill
You keep makin' me ill
Run just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears

And I swear you're just like a pill

Title: Mr Jones
Lyrics:
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Mmm
Uh huh
I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance the silence down through the morning
Sha la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah
Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
Pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I want to be someone who believes
Yeah
Mr Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
Ah, no, no, she's looking at me
Smilin' in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
Mr Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so
She's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be
Lonely
I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I wanna be someone to believe, to believe, to believe
Yeah!
Mr Jones and me
Stumbling through the Barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody love you
Oh! Son, that's just about as funky as you can be
Mr Jones and me
Starin' at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I'm wanna be just about as happy as I can be
Mr Jones and me
We're gonna be big stars

Title: How Will I Know
Lyrics:
There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming
Tell me is it really love
How will I know?
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know?
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy
(Can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love
Oh tell me how will I know?
(Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know?
(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy
(Can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
If he loves me, if he loves me not
If he loves me, if he loves me not
If he loves me, if he loves me not
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heart beat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy
(Can't speak)
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
How will I know?

How will I know?
How will I know?

Title: Venus
Lyrics:
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man a man
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no-one else had
Wa!
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Venus
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name
She's got it
Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Title: When I Grow Up
Lyrics:
Cut my tongue out, I've been caught out
Like a giant juggernaut
Happy hours, golden showers
On a cruise to freak you out
We could fly a helicopter
Nothing left to talk about
Entertain you, celebrate you
I'll be back to frame you
When I grow up I'll be stable
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
Trying hard to fit among you
Floating out to wonderland
Unprotected, God I'm pregnant
Damn the consequences
When I grow up I'll be stable
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
Blood and blisters on my fingers
Chaos rules when we're apart
Watch my temper I go mental
I'll try to be gentle
When I grow up I'll be stable
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
When I grow up
When I grow up
When I grow up I'll turn the tables
Don't take offence
Can I make amends?
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Don't take offence
Can I make amends?
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up to shreds and let it go
Rip it up in shreds and let it go

Title: World Where You Live
Lyrics:
Here's someone now who's got the muscle
His steady hand could move a mountain
Expert in bed, but come on now
There must be something missing
That golden one leads a double life
You'll find out
Tell me, I don't know where you go
Do you climb into space
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-hoo
So here we lie against each other
And these four walls can never hold us
We're looking for wide open spaces
High above the kitchen
And we're strangers here
On our way to some other place
But I don't know where you go
Do you climb into space
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-ho
To the world where you live
Friends come 'round
You might remember and be sad
Behind their eyes is unfamiliar
Do you climb into space
To the world where you live
The world where you live, oh-oh
To the world where you live, yeah, yeah
To the world where you live, hey, hey
To the world where you live
To the world where you live
To the world where you live

Title: Karma Chameleon
Lyrics:
Dessert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies, would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sale a contradiction?
You come and go, you come and go
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green
Didn't you hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along, you string along
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green
Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sale a contradiction?
You come and go, you come and go
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green

You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams

Title: Bette Davis Eyes
Lyrics:
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She's got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
She's got Greta Garbo stand-off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home
(It whets her appetite)
She'll lay you on the throne
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come up blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you
When she snows you off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious
And she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll tease you
She'll unease you
Just to please you
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll expose you
When she snows you
She knows you
She's got Bette Davis eyes...

Title: All For Love
Lyrics:
When it's love you give
(I'll be a man of good faith.)
Then in love you live
(I'll make a stand. I won't break.)
I'll be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold
When there's love inside
(I swear I'll always be strong.)
Then there's a reason why
(I'll prove to you we belong.)
I'll be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain
Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
When it's love you make
(I'll be the fire in your night.)
Then it's love you take
(I will defend, I will fight.)
I'll be there when you need me
When honor's at stake
This vow I will make
That it's all for one and all for love
Let the one be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
Don't lay our love to rest
'Cause we could stand up to the test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land
We've got it all in our hands
Now it's all for one and all for love
(It's all for love.)
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when it's all for one it's one for all
(It's one for all.)
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
When there's someone that you want
When there's someone that you need
Let's make it all, all for one and all for love

Title: Angel Of Harlem
Lyrics:
It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at JFK
Snow was melting on the ground
On BLS I heard the sound
Of an angel
New York, like a Christmas tree
Tonight this city belongs to me
Angel
Soul love... this love won't let me go
So long... angel of Harlem
Birdland on fifty-three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles, and she's got to be an angel
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
Angel
Soul love... this love won't let me go
So long... angel of Harlem
Angel of Harlem
She says it's heart... heart and soul...
Yeah yeah...(yeah)
Yeah yeah...(right now)
Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting
Blinded you lost your way
Through the side streets and the alleyway
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight
An angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah yeah... angel of Harlem
Angel... angel of Harlem...

Title: Footloose
Lyrics:
I been working so hard
Keep punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

I get this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I gotta cut

Loose, Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me offa my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're yearning, burning for some

Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut

Loose, Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose

First, we got to turn you around
Second, you put your feet on the ground
Third, now take a hold of your soul
Four, whooooooooa, I'm turning it

Loose, Footloose

Loose, Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose
Footloose
Loose, Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, Everybody cut
Everybody cut, Everybody cut
Everybody cut, Everybody cut
Everybody cut Footloose

Title: Black Hole Sun
Lyrics:
In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
And the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat
Summer stench
'Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
Sometimes, far too long for snakes
In my shoes
Walking sleep
In my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Hang my head
Drown my fear
Till you all just disappear
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
(Won't you come) (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
(Won't you come) (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
(Won't you come) (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come
Won't you come?

Title: Man I Feel Like A Woman
Lyrics:
Let's go girls, c'mon
I'm goin' out tonight, I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise, really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout
No inhibitions, make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time
The best thing about bein' a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild-yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free-yeah, feel the way I feel
Man, I feel like a woman
The girls need a break tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance, we only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down
The best thing about bein' a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild-yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free-yeah, to feel the way I feel

Title: Stuck In The Middle
Lyrics:
Well, I don't know why I came here, tonight
I've got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family all come calling
Slap you on the back and say
Please...
Please...
Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family all come calling
Slap you on the back and say
Please...
Please...
Well, I don't know why I came here, tonight
I've got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Title: No Such Thing
Lyrics:
Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls
Take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories tiny tragedies
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for

Title: Unpretty
Lyrics:
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too
Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things? To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me, hey
My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
People trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too
I'll make you feel unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you
Be in a position to make me feel so
You can buy your hair if it won't grow

Title: Better Man
Lyrics:
Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain
Give me endless summer
Lord I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old
Before my time
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
Go easy on my conscience
'Cause it's not my fault
I know I've been taught
To take the blame
Rest assured my angels
Will catch my tears
Walk me out of here
I'm in pain
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doing all I can
To be a better man
Once you've found that lover
You're homeward bound
Love is all around
Love is all around
I know some have fallen on stony ground
But Love is all around
Send someone to love me
I need to rest in arms
Keep me safe from harm
In pouring rain
Give me endless summer
Lord I fear the cold
Feel I'm getting old
Before my time
As my soul heals the shame
I will grow through this pain
Lord I'm doin' all I can
To be a better man

Title: Where Is The Love
Lyrics:
What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love (The love)?
Where is the love, the love, the love?
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?
Sing with me y'all:
One world, one world (We only got)
One world, one world (That's all we got)
One world, one world
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah

That's all we got

Title: This Charming Man
Lyrics:
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
...
Will nature make a man of me yet?
...
When in this charming car
This charming man
...
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?
...
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
...
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
...
A jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place
He said, "Return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
...
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
...
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
...
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
This charming man
...
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
This charming man
...
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy who never knew his place
...
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
...
He knows so much about these things

Title: Help Is On Its Way
Lyrics:
Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down
What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion
Sort it out
You'll make out
Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair
Don't you care
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
Don't you forget who'll take care of you
It don't matter what you do
Form a duet, let him sing melody
You'll provide the harmony
Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down
What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Title: Chains
Lyrics:
Your arms are warm but they make me feel
As if they're made of cold, cold steel
A simple kiss like a turnin' key
A little click and the lock's on me
Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands
I won't admit to where I am
That I know baby
I'm in chains, I'm in chains
I pretend I can always leave
Free to go whenever I please
But then the sound of my desperate calls
Echo off these dungeon walls
I've crossed the line from mad to sane
A thousand times and back again
I love you baby
I'm in chains, I'm in chains, I'm in chains, I'm in chains
Should have known passing through the gate
That once inside I could not have escape
I never thought this could happen to me
Never thought this is where I'd be
But baby, baby, baby, look at me
And I said baby, baby, look at me
I'm in chains, I'm in chains
(Baby baby, I'm in chains)
(Baby baby, I'm in chains)
I never thought this is where I'd be
Never thought this could happen to me, yeah
Baby baby, I'm in chains
Baby baby, I'm in chains
(Baby, look at me, I'm in chains)
Baby baby, I'm in chains
Baby baby, I'm in chains

Title: Disco 2000
Lyrics:
Well we were born within one hour of each other.
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother.
Your name is Deborah, Deborah.
It never suited ya.
And they said that when we grew up,
we'd get married, and never split up.
We never did it, although I often thought of it.
Oh Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small,
with woodchip on the wall.
When I came around to call,
you didn't notice me at all.
I said: "Let's all meet up in the year 2000.
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown.
Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road."
I never knew that you'd get married.
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.
You were the first girl at school to get breasts.
And Martyn said that you were the best.
The boys all loved you but I was a mess.
I had to watch them trying to get you undressed.
We were friends and that's as far as it went.
I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant,
oh it meant nothing to you,
cos you were so popular.
Deborah do you recall?
Your house was very small,
with woodchip on the wall.
When I came around to call,
you didn't notice me at all.
I said let's all meet up in the year 2000.
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown.
Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road.
I never knew that you'd get married.
I would be living down here on my own
on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.
Oh yeah,
oh yeah.
Oh Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small,
with woodchip on the wall.
When I came around to call,
you didn't notice me at all.
And I said let's all meet up in the year 2000.
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown.
Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road.
I never knew that you'd get married.
I would be living down here on my own,
on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.
Oh what are you doing Sunday baby.
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby.
Ohhh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh.
What are you doing Sunday baby.
Would you like to come and meet me, maybe?
You can even bring your baby.
Ooh ooh oh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Oh.

Title: Total Control
Lyrics:
Looking counter clockwise
Knowing what could happen
Any moment maybe you maybe even you
Steadfast collapse
Always certain any moment
Maybe you maybe you
Maybe even you
Recline complete dream too sweet
I can't do it not with you
Not even with you
Maybe never with you
And I'd sell my soul for
Total control
Yeah I'd sell my soul for
Total control
Street wet tonight, lovers touch
It's pure delight
Always certain any moment
Maybe even you
Stay in bed stained sheets
My head hurts I repeat
Maybe you maybe you maybe even you
And I'd sell my soul for
Total control
Yeah I'd sell my soul for
Total control
Ooh I'd sell my soul for
Total control over you
Over you
Total control over you

Title: Is This Love
Lyrics:
I should have known better than to let you go alone
It's times like these I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again
I find I spend my time waiting on your call
How can I tell you, babe, my back's against the wall
I need you by my side to tell me it's all right
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love
'Cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me
Can't stop this feeling, I've been this way before
But with you I've found the key to open any door
I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
This must be love
'Cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?

Title: Kiss From A Rose
Lyrics:
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da
There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
(And if I should fall, would it all go away?)
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the gray

Title: If You Had My Love
Lyrics:
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we
Could possibly
Spend eternity
See that's what you told me
That's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, babe
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live
With all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you
Trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt
And I don't need the pain
So before I do
Give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

Lyrics:
We are the youth
We'll take your fascism away
We are the youth
Apologize for another day
We are the youth
And politicians are so sure
We are the youth
And we are knocking on death's door
Never knew we were living in a world
With a mind that could be so sure
Never knew we were living in a world
With a mind that could be so small
Never knew we were living in a world
And the world is an open court
Maybe we don't wanna live in a world
Where our innocence is so short
We'll make it up to you
In the year 2000 with
Never knew we were living in a world
With a mind that could be so sure
Never knew we were living in a world

Never knew we were living in a world
And the world is an open court
Maybe we don't wanna live in a world
Where our innocence is so short
We'll make it up to you

And the world is an open court
Maybe we don't wanna live in a world
World who cares at all

Title: Just A Girl
Lyrics:
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a girl, a little 'ol me
Well don't let me out of your sight
Oh I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh... I've had it up to here!
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a girl I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh... I've had it up to here!
Oh... am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world...
That's all that you'll let me be!
I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worry some
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
Oh... I've had it up to!
Oh... I've had it up to!
Oh... I've had it up to here!

Title: Best Of You
Lyrics:
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist, or be abused?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I'll break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
No, I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You'd die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist, or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Lyrics:
One, two princes kneel before you
That what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
That's some bread, now
This one said he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head, now
This one he got a princely racket
That's what I said now
Got some big seal upon his jacket
Ain't in his head now
You marry him, your father will condone you
How 'bout that now
You marry me, your father will disown you
He'll eat his hat, now
Marry him, marry me
I'm the one that loved you baby can't you see?
Ain't got no future or family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought be
Said if you want to call me baby
Just go ahead now
And if you like to tell me maybe
Just go ahead now
And if you wanted to buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

Title: Have A Nice Day
Lyrics:
Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived a lie, it's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away
Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Take a look around you, nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I knocked on every door down every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness and what's left to believe?
Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, and show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, and show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day, have a nice day
When the world keeps trying, to drag me down
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground
I say, hey, have a nice day
Have a nice day
have a nice day

Hey, yeah - I wanna shoop, baby

No, not you
You, the bow-legged one, (ha-ha) yeah
What's your name?
Damn, that sounds sexy)
Here I go, here I go, here I go again (again?)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!)
Ok then, chillin', chillin', mindin' my business (word)
Yo, Salt, I looked around, and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it goin' on with somethin' kinda... uh
Wicked, wicked (oooo) - had to kick it
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits
A ho? No, that don't make me
See what I want slip slide to it swifty
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop
Shoop shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Ummm, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake booty?
If looks could kill you would be an uzi
You're a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know how does it hang?
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy mutha-
Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth black skin with a smile
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come (come) and (hmmm) give me some of that yum-yum
Chocolate chip, honey dip, can I get a scoop? (please)
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna...
Shoop shoop ba-doop (Baby, hey)
Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Shoop shoop ba-doop (Don't you know I wanna shoop, baby)
Shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop
Well let me bring you back to the subject, Pep's on the set
Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat

Title: Not Pretty Enough
Lyrics:
Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?
Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?
I live, I breathe.
I let it rain on me.
I sleep, I wake.
I try hard not to break.
I crave, I love.
I've waited long enough.
I try as hard as I can.
Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?
Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?
I laugh, I feel.
I make believe it's real.
I fall, I freeze.
I pray down on my knees.
I hold, I stand.
I take it like a man.
I try as hard as I can.
Am I not pretty enough?
Is my heart too broken?
Do I cry too much?
Am I too outspoken?
Don't I make you laugh?
Should I try it harder?
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see right through me?
Why do you see
Why do you see
Why do you see... right... through... me

Title: High
Lyrics:
When you're close to tears remember
Someday it'll all be over
One day we're gonna get so high
Though it's darker than December
What's ahead is a different color
One day we're gonna get so high
And at
The end of the day remember the days
When we were close to the end
And wonder how we made it through the night
The end of the day remember the way
We stayed so close till the end
We'll remember it was me and you
'Cause we are gonna be
Forever you and me
You will
Always keep it flying high
In the sky of love
Don't you think it's time you started
Doing what we always wanted
One day we're gonna get so high
'Cause even the impossible
Is easy when we got each other
One day we're gonna get so high
And at
The end of the day remember the days
When we were close to the end
And wonder how we made it through the night
The end of the day remember the way
We stayed so close till the end
We'll remember it was me and you
'Cause we are gonna be
Forever you and me
You will
Always keep it flying high
In the sky of love
We are gonna be
Forever you and me
You will always keep it flying high
In the sky of love
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
And at
The end of the day remember the days
When we were close to the end
And wonder how we made it through the night
The end of the day remember the way
We stayed so close till the end
We'll remember it was me and you
'Cause we are gonna be
(Forever, high forever)
Forever you and me
(Forever, you and me forever)
You will
Always keep it flying high
(Forever, high forever)
In the sky of love
(Forever, you and me forever)
'Cause we are gonna be
(Forever, high forever)
Forever you and me
(Forever, you and me forever)
You will
Always keep it flying high
(Forever, high forever)
In the sky of love
(Forever, you and me forever)
'Cause we are gonna be
(Forever, high forever)
Forever you and me
(Forever, you and me forever)
You will
Always keep it flying high
(Forever, high forever)
In the sky of love
(Forever, you and me forever)

Title: Long Day
Lyrics:
It's sitting by the overcoat
The second shelf, the note she wrote
That I can't bring myself to throw away
And also
Reach she said for no one else but you,
Cuz you won't turn away
When someone else is gone
I'm sorry 'bout the attitude
I need to give when I'm with you
But no one else would take this shit from me
And I'm so terrified of no one else but me
I'm here all the time, I won't go away
Yeah it's me, yeah I can't get myself to go away
Hey it's me and I can't get myself to go away
Oh God, I shouldn't feel this way
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no Lord your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Well I'm surprised that you'd believe
In anything that comes from me
I didn't hear from you or from someone else
And you're so
Set in life man, a pisser they're waiting
Too damn bad you get so far so fast
So what, so long
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no Lord your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Oh ain't that right?
It's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Hey it's me, yeah well I can't get myself to go away
Oh God I shouldn't feel this way now
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
And no Lord your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always ain't that right
Yeah reach down your hand in your pocket now
Reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right?
Reach down your hand in your pocket now
Reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right?
Oh ain't that right?
Ain't that right right right on child?
Right right right on child right right on child

Lyrics:
I can't seem to face up to the facts
I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax
I can't sleep, 'cause my bed's on fire
Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire
Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better
Run, run, run, run, run, run away

Oh-ho-ho-ho, aye-yi-yi-yi-yi, ooh
You start a conversation
You can't even finish it
You're talking a lot
But you're not saying anything
When I have nothing to say
My lips are sealed
Say something once, why say it again?
Psycho killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?
Fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, fa, far better
Run, run, run, run, run, run away

Title: Smalltown Boy
Lyrics:
You leave in the morning
With everything you own
In a little black case
Alone on a platform
The wind and the rain
On a sad and lonely face
Mother will never understand
Why you had to leave
But the answers you seek
Will never be found at home
The love that you need
Will never be found at home
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Pushed around and kicked around
Always a lonely boy
You were the one
That they'd talk about around town
As they put you down
And as hard as they would try
They'd hurt to make you cry
But you never cried to them
Just to your soul
No, you never cried to them
Just to your soul
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Cry, boy, cry...
You leave in the morning
With everything you own
In a little black case
Alone on a platform
The wind and the rain
On a sad and lonely face
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Title: Suck My Kiss
Lyrics:
Should have been, could have been
Would have been dead
If I didn't get the message
Goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers
Don't give a damn
Oh baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo peep
Coming from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers
Have a cold ass stare
Oh baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share
Hit me you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me
Stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss
Look at me can't you see
All I really want to be
Is free from a world
That hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Oh baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Chicka chicka dee
Do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound
Of bow wow wow
Oh baby do me now
Do me here I do allow
Hit me you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me
Stick with this
Is she gonna curtsy
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to...
Should of been, could of been
Would of been dead
If I didn't get the message
Goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers
Don't give a damn
Oh baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo peep
Coming from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers
Have a cold ass stare
Oh baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share
Hit me you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me
Stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to suck my kiss

Title: Fast Car
Lyrics:
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way

Title: Unbelievable
Lyrics:
You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies.
You're always askin' what it's all about,
Don't listen to my replies.
You say to me I don't talk enough,
But when I do I'm a fool.
These times I've spent, I've realized,
I'm gonna shoot through, and leave you.
The things, you say,
Your purple prose just gives you away.
The things, you say,
You're unbelievable.
Oh!
What the f**k...
What the f**k...
Whoa bad...
You burden me with your problems,
By telling me more bout mine.
I'm always so concerned,
With the way you say,
You're always at stop,
To think of us,
Being one is more than I'd ever known.
But this time I realize,
I'm gonna shoot through, and leave you.
The things, you say,
Your purple prose just gives you away.
The things, you say,
You're unbelievable.
Oh!
What the f**k...
Good point...
What the f**k...
Good point...
What the f**k...
Good point...
What the f**k...
Whoa bad...
Seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us.
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times
Pushing down the better few
Instead of bringing out just want, the world,
And never think of your attitude.
Brace yourself, with the grace of ease,
I know this world, ain't what it seems!
What the f**k...
Whoa bad...
It's unbelievable.
You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies.
You're always askin' what it's all about,
Don't listen to my replies.
You say to me I don't talk enough,
But when I do I'm a fool.
These times I've spent, I've realized,
I'm gonna shoot through, and leave you.
The things, you say,
Your purple prose just gives you away.
The things, you say,
Before I love you more.
The things, you say,
Your purple prose just gives you away.
The things, you say,
You're unbelievable.
Oh!
What the f**k...
Good point...
What the f**k...
You're so unbelievable.
Good point...
What the f**k...
Good point...
What the f**k...
You're unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
Whoa...
What the f**k...

Title: Speed Of Sound
Lyrics:
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like
Where to? Where do I go?
If you've never tried then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll stop before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up
All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
Or the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China, all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand
(Drums and guitar)
All those signs I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand

There was a Buffalo Soldier
in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa

To me it makes a lot of sense
How the Dreadlock Rasta
was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa
brought to America
Fighting on arrival
fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier
in the heart of America
If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am
I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa
brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier

Title: Cry Me A River
Lyrics:
You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say, what you did,
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry, cry me a river
Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river
Cry me a river-er, yea yea
I know that they say
That somethings are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
(Yea.)
You don't have to say, what you did,

(All alone)
Now you tell me you need me

Title: Shimmer
Lyrics:
She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low
Feeling short of stable
All that she intends
And all she keeps inside
Isn't on the label
She says she's ashamed
Can she take me for a while?
Can I be a friend?
We'll forget the past
Or maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again
She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise
Pink linen on white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies
Reality escapes her
She says that love
Is for fools that fall behind
And I'm somewhere between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend
We're here and now
Will we ever be again?
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
Ah-ow
Yeah, it's too far away for me to hold
Too far away, ah-ow
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away, ah-ow
It's too far away for me to hold
Too far away
Guess I'll let it go

Title: Perfect
Lyrics:
I don't want half hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares.
Life is too short to play silly games
I've promised myself I won't do that again.
It's got to be perfect
It's got to be worth it
yeah.
Too many people take second best
But I won't take anything less
It's got to be
yeah
pertect.
Young hearts are foolish
they make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away.
Well
I have been foolish too many times
Now I'm determined I'm gonna get it right.
It's got to be perfect...
Young hearts are foolish
they make such mistakes
It's got to be perfect...
It's got to be
yeah
worth it
it's got to be perfect.

I've got the gift gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body
Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness, every girl every man
Houston do you hear me
Ground-control can you feel me
need permission to land
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ
Cause you're keepin' me up all night
Singin' in the classes, music for your masses
Give no head, no backstage passes
Have a proper giggle, I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mike, I rock the mike
(Right)
You got no love then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl but your best friend can
It's time to move your body
I don't wanna be sleazy,
baby just tease me
Got no family planned
Houston do you hear me
Ground-control can you feel me
need permission to land
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ
Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ
Cause you're keepin' me up all night
Pimpin' ain't easy
Most of them fleece me every night
Pimpin' ain't easy
But if you're sellin' it, it's alright
Come on
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna to stop DJ
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't wanna rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Title: Itchycoo Park
Lyrics:
Over Bridge of Sighs
To rest my eyes in shades of green
Under dreaming spires
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been
[(What did you do there?)] I got high
[(What did you feel there?)] Well, I cried
[(But why the tears there?)] Tell you why
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun
I'll tell you what I'll do [(What will you do?)]
I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school [(Won't that be cool?)]
Why go to learn the words of fools?
[(What will we do there?)] We'll get high
[(What will we touch there?)] We'll touch the sky
[(But why the tears there?)] I'll tell you why
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
Ha
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful

Title: Material Girl
Lyrics:
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
...
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's alright with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play, no way, no way
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day
'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
...
Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world
Boys may come and boys may go
And that's alright you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
...
A material, a material
A material, a material world
Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world
(Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world

Title: Love Is All Around
Lyrics:
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all around me
And so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go, oh yes, it is
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show, oh
You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up
By the way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking
Of all the things you said, oh yes I did
You gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything and I do, oh yes I do
You know, I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the
Way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end
'Cause on my love you can depend
Got to keep it movin'
Ooh, it's written in the wind
Oh, everywhere I go, yeah, ooh well
So if you really love me, love me, love me
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show

Title: Fantasy
Lyrics:
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
Sweet sweet fantasy baby

Title: Father Figure
Lyrics:
That's all I wanted
Something special something sacred in your eyes
For just one moment to be bold and naked at your side
Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever say it can be
W-h-o-a...
That's all you wanted
Something special someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment to be warm and naked at my side
Sometimes I think that you never understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together we'd be happy
W-h-o-a baby
I will be your father figure
Oh baby
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Be your daddy
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
Except me
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
Do it do it do it do it oh baby
That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover understands me
(understands me)
If we have faith in each other then we can be strong baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
My baby
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time
If you are the desert I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger hunger for me
Whatever you ask for that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared but then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling don't think of me...
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes baby-baby-baby
And love can't lie no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always telling me so
(heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on hold on
Won't let you go my baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mine baby
I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
So I am gonna love you 'til the end of time
I will be your father
I will be your...
I will be your preacher
(I'll be your daddy)
I'll be your daddy
W-h-o-a
I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time...

Title: Somebody Told Me
Lyrics:
Breakin' my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
A breakin' my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
Ready let's roll onto something new
Takin' it's toll then I'm leaving without you
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A rushing, rushing around
Pace yourself for me
I said maybe, baby, please
But I just don't know now
When all I want to do is try
Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

Title: The Horses
Lyrics:
We will fly, way up high, where the cold wind blows
Or in the sun, laughin' havin' fun, with all the people that she knows
And if the situation, should keep us separated, you know the world won't fall apart
And you will free the beautiful bird, that's caught inside your heart
Can't you hear her, oh she cries so loud
Casts her wild note, over water and cloud
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
We'll be riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin'
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up
You will grow, and until you go, I'll be right there by your side
And even then, whisper the wind, and she will carry up your ride
I hear all the people of the world (people of the world), in one bird's lonely cry
See them tryin' every way they know how, to make their spirit fly
Can't you see him, he's down on the ground
He has a broken wing, looking all around
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin' (be little darlin')
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (in the sky little darlin')
Oh, and if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin' (be little darlin')
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (in the sky little darlin')
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses yeah yeah (Pick you up darlin' if you fall)
Way up in the sky little darlin' (Don't you worry 'bout a thing little girl)
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up (Because I was young myself not so long ago)
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin'
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses, yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (And when I was young oh I was a wild one)
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'

Title: She Drives Me Crazy
Lyrics:
I can't stop
The way I feel
Things you do
Don't seem real
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waitin' 'rounds killin' me
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I can't get
Any rest
People say
I'm obsessed
Everything that's serious lasts
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I won't make it
On my own
No one likes
To be alone
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

Title: Solsbury Hill
Lyrics:
Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
(I) just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
"Son," he said "Grab your things,
I've come to take you home."
To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
"Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
"Hey" he said "Grab your things
I've come to take you home."
Back home
When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
"Hey" I said "You can keep my things,
they've come to take me home."

Title: Love Of The Common People
Lyrics:
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do, hmmm?
Tears from your little sister
Crying because she doesn't have
A dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by
'Cause she's living in
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
It's a good thing
You don't have a bus fare
It would fall through the hole
In your pocket and you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You got to walk into town
To find a job
Tryin' to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
Somehow you'd better go home
Where it's warm
Where you can live in
The love of the common people
Smile from the heart
Of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
'Cause we take 'em in stride
For family pride
You know that faith
Is in your foundation
With a whole lot of love
And a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
It's makin' it strong
Where you belong
And we're living in
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can
Yes, we're living in
the love of the common people
smile's from the heart
Of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
Living in
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
Living in
The love of the common people
smile's really hard
On a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

Title: Pull Up To The Bumper
Lyrics:
Driving down those city streets
Waiting to get down
Won't you take your big machine
Somewhere in this town
Now in the parking lot garage
I found the proper place
Just follow all the written rules
You'll fit into the space
Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between
Pull up, to it,
Don't drive, through it
Back it, up twice
Now that fits nice
Operate around the clock,
Slow it if you come in?
I've got lots of space for everyone
One for you my friend?
My lines are short I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on,
Shiny sleek machine you wheeled
I've got to blow your horn.
Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limosine,
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between.
Pull up to it, don't drive through it,
Back it, up twice, now that fits nice,
Grease it, spray it
Let me lubricate it
Pull up to my bumper baby (to end)

Lyrics:
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Well life is a cigarette, smoked to the end,
But if you rock it a little bit,
Then you burn all your friends,
The wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes it's true,
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Take a look through your window now,
You're all alone on the road,
Well you'll burn all your bridges down,
And now you're losing control,
The wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes it's true,
If you make a mistake where you couldn't relate to your groove, (yes, that's true)
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Well now that I've met you,
I'll love you as a friend,
Yeah but your love is mogadon,
Love is the end,
Well, the wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes it's true,
If you make a mistake well you couldn't relate to your groove, yes it's true,
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?
Can you hear us pumping on your stereo?

Title: Try Again
Lyrics:
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give up, or try again
If I hesitated to let you in?
Now would you be yourself or play your role?
Tell all the boys, I keep it low
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off, or would you stay?
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (and again)
I'm in to you, you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not 'til I see, whether this could be
Could be eternity, or just a week
Ayo our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thing, we'll see how it goes
You don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date, what about the next date
Huh, huh, huh, huh
I said you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be bugging on the first date, what about the next date?
Huh, huh, huh, huh
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky

Title: Sunsets
Lyrics:
Sunsets over the beaches from now on
Each day looking for new ways to go on
Maybe I should drop by maybe I should have called
Maybe I should have followed you and beat down your door
Maybe it's gonna be breaking you every time you fall
But to shower you with pity will do you no good at all
Slow burn watching the world turn from my arms
New way of measuring each day until it's gone
Maybe I should drop by maybe I should have called
Maybe I should have followed you and beat down your door
Maybe it's gonna be breaking you every time you fall
But to shower you with pity will do you no good at all
Sunrise building a reprise in my heart
Regret tight around my chest plays its part
Until it's gone, Until it's gone...
But to shower you with pity will do you no good at all
No good at all
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset...
over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches...
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset...
over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches...
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset...
over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches...
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset...
over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches...
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset...
over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches...

Title: Blue Sky Mine
Lyrics:
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Hey, hey, hey
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)
My gut is wrenched out, it is crunched up and broken
My life that is lived is no more than a token
Who'll strike the flint upon the stone and tell me why?
If I yell out at night there's a reply of blue silence
The screen is no comfort, I can't speak my sentence
They blew the lights at heaven's gate and I don't know why
But if I work all day on the blue sky mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Still I walk up and down on the blue sky mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)
The candy store paupers lie to the shareholders
They're crossing their fingers, they pay the truth makers
The balance sheet is breaking up the sky
So I'm caught at the junction, still waiting for medicine
The sweat of my brow keeps on feeding the engine
Hope the crumbs in my pocket can keep me for another night
And if the blue sky mining company won't come to my rescue
If the sugar refining company won't save me
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
But if I work all day on the blue sky mine
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
And if walk up and down on the blue sky mine
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)
And some have sailed from a distant shore
(And the company takes what the company wants)
And nothing's as precious as a hole in the ground
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
I pray that sense and reason brings us in
Who's gonna save me?
Who's gonna save me?
We got nothing to fear
In the end the rain comes down
In the end the rain comes down
Washes clean the streets of the blue sky town

Lyrics:
Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
Hey little sister, who's the Superman?
Hey little sister, who's the one you want?
Hey little sister, shotgun!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
Hey little sister, who is it you're with? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little sister, what's your vice or wish? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little sister, shotgun, oh yeah
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, shotgun!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again, ow!
"Pick it up!
Take me back home, yeah!"
Hey little sister, what have you done? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hey little sister, who's the only one? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've been away for so long (So long)
I've been away for so long (So long)
I let you go for so long
It's a nice day to start again
C'mon, it's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again, ow!
There is nothing fair in this world, baby
There is nothing safe in this world
And there's nothing sure in this world
And there's nothing pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again
C'mon, it's a nice day for a white wedding, wow!
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again.

Title: Georgia On My Mind
Lyrics:
Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
(Georgia on my mind)
I said Georgia
Georgia
A song of you
(A song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
I said Georgia
Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Georgia
Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just this old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
I said just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind

Title: Foolish Games
Lyrics:
You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that
I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You were always the mysterious one
with dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
Then you stood in my doorway with nothing to say
beside some comment on the weather
Well in case you failed to notice
in case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
These foolish games are tearing me apart
Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
Youre breaking my heart
You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and youd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
Excuse me, think Ive mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself
These foolish games are tearing me apart
Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
Youre breaking my heart
You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that

Title: Give Me The Night
Lyrics:
Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night
You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine
A little late romance
It's a chain reaction
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night
So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?
Just give me the night
Give me the night
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night
So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see
That starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly?
And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street
Until the morning light
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night...

Title: Glycerine
Lyrics:
It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind, it's not my kind
It's not my time, to wonder why
Everything gone white, everything's grey
Now you're here, now you're away
I don't want this, remember that
I'll never forget, where you're at
Don't let the days go by
Glycerine, glycerine
I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time
Are you at one, or do you lie
We live in a wheel, where everyone steals
But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields
If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste
Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me
Glycerine, glycerine
Don't let the days go by, glycerine
Don't let the days go by
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Glycerine, glycerine
Oh, glycerine, glycerine
Bad moon whine again
Bad moon whine again
As she falls around me
I needed you more, we wanted us less
Could not kiss, just regress
It might just be me, simple, and plain
Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names
Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you you you
Glycerine, glycerine
Glycerine, glycerine

Title: Berlin Chair
Lyrics:
If half of what I'm saying, of what I'm saying is true
Will you rub my head, make it all shiny and new?
And you drag my coat tails, drag my coat tails down
and I'll be the only cold assed king around.
If you wait I'll give all my aches to you.
Take the chance, to ignore what you're going through?
My cold hand is there for you to take
(If you leave, can I fall down)
I'm your Berlin Chair, won't you lean on me 'til I break.
I'll ignore each golden, dragging kiss you can give.
On the blankest face that you ever had to forgive.
If you see my fallings, see my failings through.
I'm the re-run that you'll always force yourself to sit through.
If you wait I'll give all my aches to you.
Take the chance, to ignore what you're going through?
My cold hand is there for you to take
(If you leave, can I fall down)
I'm your Berlin Chair, won't you lean on me 'til I break.
Well you're too late. You're too late.
You're too late.

Title: Proud Mary
Lyrics:
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost a minute of sleepin'
An' worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on the river boat Queen
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Well if you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
The big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Alright rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Turn it up
Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again and I think its a sin yes

A southern man don't need him around anyhow
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord I'm coming home to you
In Birmingham they love the governor

Now watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?

Title: You Can Call Me Al
Lyrics:
A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I soft in the middle now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
When the rest of my life is so hard!
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger, Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away, my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me!
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And whoa, my nights are so long!
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role-model?
Now that my role-model is
Gone, gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly, little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al
*long flute solo*
A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning into infinity
He says, Amen! and Hallelujah!
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al (Call me)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na ...
If you'll be my bodyguard...
I can call you Betty...
If you'll be my bodyguard...
I can call you betty...
If you'll be my bodyguard...

Gît sur mon lit
A bouffé sa langue
En buvant (tronc) mon whisky
Quant à moi
Peu dormi, vidé, brimé
J'ai dû dormir dans la gouttière
Où j'ai eu un flash
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!
En quatre couleurs
Allez hop!
Un matin
Une (louloute) est venue chez-moi
Poupée de Cellophane
Cheveux chinois
Un sparadrap
Une gueule de bois
A bu ma bière
Dans un grand verre
En caoutchouc
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!
Comme un indien dans son igloo

Ça plane pour moi moi moi moi moi

Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!

Allez hop! La nana
Quel panard!
Quelle vibration!
De s'envoyer
Sur le paillasson
Limée, ruinée, vidée, comblée
"You are the King of the divan!"
Qu'elle me dit en passant
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!
I am the King of the divan
Ça plane pour moi
Ça plane pour moi
Ça plane pour moi moi moi moi moi
Ça plane pour moi
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!
Ça plane pour moi
Allez hop!
T'occupe
T'inquiète
Touche pas ma planète
It's not today
Quel le ciel me tombera sur la tête
Et que l'alcool me manquera
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!
Ça plane pour moi
Allez hop! Ma nana
S'est tirée
S'est barrée
Enfin c'est (marre) à tout casser
L'évier, le bar me laissant seul
Comme un grand connard
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!
Le pied dans le plat
Ça plane pour moi
Ça plane pour moi
Ça plane pour moi moi moi moi moi
Ça plane pour moi
Hou! Hou! Hou! Hou!

I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love
It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
How I want to be free, baby
How I want to be free
How I want to break free
But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free
I've got to break free
I want to break free
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free

Now that you? ve realized the prides arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart, it? s a start, a work of art
To revolutionize, make a change, nothin? s strange
People, people, we are the same
No, we? re not the same, 'cause we don? t know the game
What we need is awareness, we can? t get careless
You say what is this?
My beloved, let's get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
Yo, bum rush the show

Nothing but rednecks for four hundred years if you check
Don? t worry be happy was a number one jam
Damn, if I say it you can slap me right here
Let's get this party started right
Right on, c? mon, what we got to say

Make everybody see in order to fight the powers that be

Title: Kashmir
Lyrics:
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, with stars to fill my dream.
I am a traveler of both time and space to be where I have been.
To sit with elders of a gentle race this world has seldom seen.
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed.
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear.
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear.
Whoa-oh-hoh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Oooh, oh, baby, I've been flyin'
No, yeah, mama cares, ain't no denyin'
Oh, oooh yeah, I've been flyin'
Mama My, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no...
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground.
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land.
Tryin' to find, tryin' to find where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah...
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
like thoughts inside a dream.
Heed the path that led me to that place with yellow desert stream.
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again.
Sure as the dust that blows high in June, when movin' through Kashmir.
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear.
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-hoh, oh, ohh
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way you stay, yeah-eah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down, so down...
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there...
Oh, oh, come on, come on, oh, let me take you there...
Let me take you there, woo, yeah-yeah, woo, yeah-yeah
Let me take you there...

Workouts in the health spa, muscles grow

Body, it's so good, my body
You can tell a macho, he has a funky walk
his western shirts and leather, always look so boss
Funky with his body, he's a king
call him Mister Ego, dig his chains
You can best believe that, he's a macho man
likes to be the leader, he never dresses grand
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

To live a life of freedom, machos make a stand
Have your own lifestyles and ideals
Possess the strength of confidence, that's the skill
You can best believe that he's a macho man
He's the special god son in anybody's land
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Macho, macho man

Title: Where The Wild Roses Grow
Lyrics:
They call me 'The Wild Rose'
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
From the first day I saw her, I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the color of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face
They call me 'The Wild Rose'
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me that, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
On the second day, I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I've seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"
On the second day, he came with a single red rose
He said, "Give me your loss and your sorrow"
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
"If I show you the roses, will you follow?"
They call me 'The Wild Rose'
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me that, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
On the third day, he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist
On the last day, I took her where the wild roses grow
She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
And I lent down and planted a rose between her teeth
They call me 'The Wild Rose'
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
My name was Elisa Day
For my name was Elisa Day

Title: Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic
Lyrics:
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she doe just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
Ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Thing she does is magic
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing she do is magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic

Title: Bitter Sweet Symphony
Lyrics:
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, this life
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no (have you ever been down?) no, no
Well, I've never prayed
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?
I can't change it you know, I can't change it
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony this life
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
You know I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
You've gotta change my mould, no, no, no
(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(Been down)
(Ever been down)
(Can't change my violence, melody and silence)
(Ever been down)
(Ever been down)
(Ever been down)
(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)
(Have you ever been down?)

Title: Kiss
Lyrics:
You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body, baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your
...Kiss
You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, Mama
I know how to undress me, yeah
I want to be your fantasy
Maybe you could be mine?
You just leave it all up to me
We could have a good time
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your

Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude (Uh)
You just leave it all up to me
My love... will be your food

Title: Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover
Lyrics:
That old dog has chained you up alright
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream, I was your hero
Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed, oh, oh
Open up on the inside, gonna fill you up, gonna make you cry
This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
Give you somethin' sweet each time
You come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good?
Don't say you'll stay 'cause then you go away
Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks, for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn, I wish I was your lover
If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rollin' Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through Heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I sat on a mountainside with peace of mind
And I lay by the ocean
Makin' love to her with visions clear
Walked the days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you
Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks, for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine, I'll grow out of it
Damn, I wish I was your lover
Just open up I'm gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up I wanna make you cry
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Gettin' on the subway and I'm comin' uptown
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Standin' on a street corner waitin' for my love to change
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Feelin' like a school boy, too shy and too young
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Open up I wanna come inside, I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Gettin' on my camel and I'll ride it uptown, ooh
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Hanging around this jungle, wishing that this

Title: Copacabana (At The Copa)
Lyrics:
Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star, Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor, they worked from eight til four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?
At the Copa, (Co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana, (here)
At the Copa, (Co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa ... they fell in love
His name was Rico, he wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancin' there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far, Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?
At the Copa, (Co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the Copa, (Co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa (scream) she lost her love (Copa, Copacabana)
Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's the disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear, faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind!
At the Copa, (Co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana, (here)
At the Copa, (Co) Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa ... don't fall in love
Don't fall in love

Title: Message To My Girl
Lyrics:
I don't want to say, "I love you"
That would give away too much
It's hip to be detached and precious
The only thing you feel is vicious
I don't want to say, "I want you"
Even though I want you so much
It's wrapped up in conversation
It's whispered in a hush
Though I'm frightened by the words
Think it's time I made it heard
CHORUS
No more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that
Now, I wake up happy
Warm in a lover's embrace
No one else can touch us
While we're in this place
So I'll sing it to the world
This simple message to my girl
CHORUS
Though I'm frightened by the words
Think it's time I made it heard
So I'll sing it to the world
A simple message to my girl
CHORUS
Oh, there's nothing quite as real
As the touch of your sweet hand
I can't spend the rest of my life
Buried in the sand
Oh, every night I hear you call my name
I'm gonna sleep in my thoughts that roam
Oh, every night to express my pain
But I won't get wrapped in your tomb
No, I don't care, I don't care why you've gone now
And every night sings the same song, same song
I hear hear humming in my sleep
I don't want to say
I don't want to say
I can't spend the rest of my life
Buried in the sand

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Yeah, you should be mine, mine, ooh!
Mmm yes, you could be mine, tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armor
Coming to your emotional rescue

I will be your knight in shining armor

Title: Time After Time
Lyrics:
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after sometimes you picture me
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
You said, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Lyrics:
Eh-he-he-he
My baby's always dancing
I would'nt be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
An' Thats no lie
We spent the night in 'frisco
At every kind of disco
From the night I kissed our love good-bye
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me
Like somebody has drugged me
The spellbound rhythm gets me
On my feet
I changed my life completely
I seen that lightning leave me
And my baby just cant take her eyes off me
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Blame it on the boogie
This magic music moves me
That dirty rhythm grooves me
The devil's got in to me
With his dance
I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight

Title: All I Want Is You
Lyrics:
You say,
you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say,
you want
your story to remain untold
All the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say,
you'll give me
a highway with no-one on it
Treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
You say,
you'll give me
eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
But all the promises we make,
from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say,
you want
your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
You say,
you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
All the promises we break,
from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
A tuber
when the trees just a best
Of old anywhere
what do when I can tuber
Oh trees just right
And king does for
and to got it old and old

Title: Ready Or Not
Lyrics:
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Make you want me
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates Those who fake, they break,
When they meet their 400 pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week.
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Make you want me
Yo, I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're Doo Doo
Voo Doo, I can do what you do, easy
Belive me, frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defacating on your microphone
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly
You can't run away
From these styles I got,
Oh baby, hey baby
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know,
Oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from the block, oh no
Ready or not, refugees takin' over
The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushin' up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die,
Toss me high - only puff la, With my crew from lock high
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes)
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide (Ay, yo, nobody move)
Gonna Find You
And Make you want me
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Make you want me

Title: I Want Your Sex
Lyrics:
There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes
I swear I won't tease you won't tell you no lies
Yeah
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes
I've waited so long baby now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience and here's where mine ends
I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex
It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go?
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!
I swear I won't tease you won't tell you no lies
Yeah
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes
Oooo

Title: Red Red Wine
Lyrics:
Red, red wine, goes to my head,
Makes me forget that I
Still need you so
Red, red wine, it's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go
I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
I'd have sworn that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart

Title: Bad
Lyrics:
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on, Come on
Lay it on me all right
I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad come on (You know that I'm bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad you know it (You know that I'm bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad come on, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad
The word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
And my friends you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad come on (You know that I'm bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad you know it (You know that I'm bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad you know it, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face
Because I'm bad, I'm bad come on (You know that I'm bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad you know it (You know that I'm bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad you know it, you know

Title: Dumb Things
Lyrics:
Welcome, strangers, to the show
I'm the one who should be lying low
Saw the knives out, turned my back
Heard the train coming, stayed out on the track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
Caught the fever, heard the tune
Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon
Started howling, made no sense
Thought my friends would rush to my defence
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
And I get all your good advice
It doesn't stop me from going through these things twice
I see the knives out, I turn my back
I hear the train coming, I stay right on that track
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
I melted wax to fix my wings
I've done all the dumb things
I threw my hat into the ring
I've done all the dumb things
I thought that I just had to sing
I've done all the dumb things

Title: Four Seasons In One Day
Lyrics:
Four seasons in one day
Lying in the depths of your imagination
Worlds above and worlds below
The sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain
Even when you're feeling warm
The temperature could drop away
Like four seasons in one day
Smiling as the shit comes down
You can tell a man from what he has to say
Everything gets turned around
And I will risk my neck again, again
You can take me where you will
Up the creek and through the mill
Like all the things you can't explain
Four seasons in one day
Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day
It doesn't pay to make predictions
Sleeping on an unmade bed
Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain
Only one step away
Like four seasons in one day
Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day

Title: Hanging On The Telephone
Lyrics:
I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall
I know he's there, but I just had to call
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
I heard your mother, now she's going out the door
Did she go to work or just go to the store?
All those things she said, I told you to ignore
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long
If I don't get your calls then everything goes wrong
I want to tell you something you've known all along
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection
Oh, I can't control myself
Oh, I can't control myself
Oh, I can't control myself
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh)
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh)
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh)
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh, woh, woh, woh)
Run to me, yeah

Title: Comfortably Numb
Lyrics:
Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more... aaaaaaaah!
But you might feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going, for the show
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become
Comfortably numb.

Title: All Out Of Love
Lyrics:
I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
Oh, what are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right

Title: Love Thy Will Be Done
Lyrics:
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run
No longer can I resist the guiding light
It gives me the power to keep up the fight
Love... thy will be done
Since I have found you my life has just begun
And I see all of your creations as one
Perfect complex
No one less beautiful or more special than the next
We are all blessed and so wise to accept
Thy will love be done
Love, thy will be mine
And make me strive for the glorious and divine
I could not be more, more satisfied (satisfiedÃ¢â¬ ¦)
Even when there's no peace outside my window
There's peace inside
And that's why I no longer run (I don't knowÃ¢â¬ ¦)
Love thy will be done
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run (noÃ¢â¬ ¦.)
Love, thy will be done
Thy will love be done
No longer can I resist (no.) the guiding light (guiding light)
The light that gives me the power to keep up the fight
I couldn't be more satisfied (noÃ¢â¬ ¦)
Even when there's no peace outside my window
There's peace inside
And that's why I can not longer run
Love thy will be done (thy will be done, done, doneÃ¢â¬ ¦)
Love, thy will be done
I can no longer hide
I can no longer run
Love, thy will be done
Thy will love be done
Love, thy will be done

Title: More Than A Woman
Lyrics:
Oh, girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman (Ooh)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Ooh, ooh, baby)
More than a woman to me
Oh, oh, oh
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking 'bout those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever
Just a minute at a time
More than a woman (You are)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Ooh, my baby)
More than a woman to me
Oh, oh, oh
More than a woman (Ooh)
More than a woman to me (Oh, so much more)
More than a woman (Oh, baby)
More than a woman to me (Ooh)
More than a woman (Ooh)
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (Oh, oh, my baby)
More than a woman to me (Yeah, yeah)
More than a woman.

Title: Believe
Lyrics:
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think I'm strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
What am I supposed to do
Sit around and wait for you
Well I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
Cause I've got time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Well I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No I don't need you anymore
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something nside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough
Do you believe in life after love
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough

Title: Rehab
Lyrics:
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab
But I won't go, go, go
The man said "Why you think you here?"
I said "I got no idea"
"I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby"
"So I always keep a bottle near"
He said "I just think you're depressed"
"Kiss me, here baby, and go rest"
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I don't ever want to drink again
I just, ooh I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I'm on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab
But won't go, go, go!

Title: Babooshka
Lyrics:
Babooshka
Babooshka
She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worst move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them
With a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter
All yours
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya
All yours
Babooshka, babooshka, babooshka ya ya
Babooshka
She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out
I'm all yours

Title: Tainted Love
Lyrics:
Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears, and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh oh)
Tainted love
Now I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away, you don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears, and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (Oh oh)
Tainted love
Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love
Tainted love

Title: Tears In Heaven
Lyrics:
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven
Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please, begging please
Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you be the same
If I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Title: Manic Monday
Lyrics:
Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
That's my funday
An I-don't-have-to-run day
It's just another manic Monday
Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
When the bus is already there
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
An I-don't-have-to-run day
It's just another manic Monday
All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
Ah I-don't-have-to-run day
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my funday
It's just another manic Monday

Title: Key Largo
Lyrics:
Wrapped around each other
Trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together
Lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies
Falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero
And you were my leading lady
We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
Honey can't you remember
We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender
When you gave me your heart
Please say you will... play it again
'Cause I love you still
Baby this can't be the end
We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo

Title: I Love The Night Life
Lyrics:
Please don't talk about love tonight.
Please don't talk about sweet love.
Please don't talk about being true
And all the trouble we've been through.
Ah, please don't talk about all of the plans
We had for fixin' this broken romance.
I want to go where the people dance.
I want some action I want to live!
Action, I got so much to give.
I want to give it.
I want to get some too.
Oh, I
Oh, I
I love the nightlife
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Please don't talk about love tonight.
Your sweet talking won't make it right.
Love and lies just bring me down
When you've got women all over town.
You can love them all and when you're through
Maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you.
I got to go where the people dance.
I want some action I want to live!
Action, I got so much to give.
I want to give it, I want to get some too.
Oh, I
Oh, I
I love the nightlife
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.
I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yea.

Title: Everybody Wants To Rule The World
Lyrics:
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world
All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts for ever
Everybody wants to rule the world

Title: (Just Like) Starting Over
Lyrics:
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone
It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you, darlin'
It's like we both are fallin' in love again
It'll be just like startin' over, startin' over
Everyday we used to make it, love
Why can't we be makin' love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love
It'll be just like startin' over, startin' over
Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well darlin'
It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you, darlin'
It's like we both are fallin' in love again
It'll be just like startin' over, startin' over
Look out
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, mm, we have grown
Although our love still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere
Startin' over
Oo-oo-oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

But I still don't understand

Title: Born To Be Wild
Lyrics:
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Yeah, darlin'
Gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under
Yeah, darlin'
Gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Yeah, darlin'
Gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild

Title: The Day You Went Away
Lyrics:
Hey, does it ever make you wonder
what's on my mind?
Hey, I was only ever running back to your side
I never cried, I just watched my life go by
It's just a pack of lies,
'cause you're leaving me behind
Why, after this long is there nothing
I'll keep, oh, I can shout
you'll pretend you're falling asleep
I live a lie, yeah, believing that you're mine
It's just a waste of time
'cause you're leaving me behind
Hey, there's not a cloud in the sky
It's as blue as your goodbye
and I thought that it would rain
on a day like today
Hey, there's not a cloud in sight
it's as blue as your blue goodbye
and I thought that it would rain
the day you went away
Hey, does it ever make you wonder what's on my mind
Ooh yeah, I was only ever running back to your side
Hey, there's not a cloud in the sky
it's as blue as your goodbye
and I thought that it would rain
on a day like today
Hey, there's not a cloud in sight
it's as blue as your blue goodbye
and I thought that it would rain
the day you went away
He's on the buses, and the aeroplanes
with some groceries and a sleeping bag...

Title: Mamma Mia
Lyrics:
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

Title: Bizarre Love Triangle
Lyrics:
Every time I think of you
I feel a shot right through into a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
And every day my confusion grows
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say
I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll say the words that I can't say

Lyrics:
There you were freaking out,
Trying to get your head around the fact that me and you and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide what you really want from me
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
'Cause you make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screaming and hollering
How could this love become so paper thin?
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that?
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Seems like you're steppin' on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love you, love you
With a Little L you know
That's the way you make me love you, yeah
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you, with a Little L
You make me love you

Title: Learn To Fly
Lyrics:
Run and tell all of the angels, this could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
me up a new revolution 'cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die
Yeah, I'm lookin' to the sky to save me
Lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication
Lookin' 'cause I'm tired of lyin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
I think I'm dyin' nursing patience
It can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright
I'm lookin' to the sky to save me
Lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for somethin' to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication
Lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to...
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
I'm lookin' to the sky to save me
Lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for somethin' to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication
Lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to...
I'm lookin' to the sky to save me
Lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication
Lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
Make my way back home when I learn to...

Title: My Way
Lyrics:
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all
And I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
"Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way"
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way

Title: Cheap Wine
Lyrics:
Words and Music by Don Walker.
Once I smoked a Danneman cigar,
I drove a foreign car,
But baby that was years ago;
I left it all behind,
I had a friend, I heard she died,
On a needle she was crucified,
Baby that was years ago.
I left all behind, for my
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Come-on, come-on, come-on,
I don't mind takin' charity,
From those that I despise,
Baby I don't need your love
I don't need your love.
Baby you can shout at me,
But can't meet my eyes,
I don't really need your love,
I don't need your love. I got my
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Come-on, come-on, come-on,
Sitting on a beach drinkin' rocket fuels, oh yeah!
Spent the whole night breaking all the rules, oh yeah!
Mendin' every minute of the day before,
Watching the ocean, watching the shore,
Watching the sunrise and thinkin' there could never be more,
Never be more, yeah!
Well anytime you wanna find me find me,
I don't have a telephone,
I'm another world away,
But I'll always feel at home, with my
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Come-on, come-on, come-on,
come-on, come-on,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Come-on, come-on, come-on,
come-on, come-on,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Come-on, come-on, come-on,
I left her for my, my my,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Cheap wine and a three-day growth,
Come-on,

Title: Justify My Love
Lyrics:
Y-e-a-h...
I wanna kiss you in Paris
I wanna hold your hand in Rome
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross country
You put this in me
So now what?
So now what?
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) Hoping
(my love) Praying
For you to justify my love
(moaning)
Okay
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't wanna be your mother
I don't wanna be your sister either
I just wanna be your lover
I wanna have your baby
Kiss me that's right kiss me
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) Yearning
(my love) Burning
For you to justify my love
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Talk to me
Tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend on the permission of another
Love me that's right love me
I wanna be your baby
M-m-m-m... y-e-a-h...
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) I'm open
(my love) Ready
For you to justify my love
(my love) To justify my love
(my love) Wanting to justify
(for you to justify my love)
Waiting (my love) justify my love
(my love) Praying to justify
(for you to justify my love)
To justify my love
I'm open to justify my love
(my love my love)

Title: Walk This Way
Lyrics:
Now there's a backseat lover
That's always under cover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on her muffin"
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheer leader
That's a real big pleaser
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing love it
Was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this
She starts swingin'
With the boys in tune
And her feet just fly up in the air
Singin' hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
And they swingin' like it just don't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Well like this
Like this
School girl sleazy
With a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hangin' way up her knee
It was three young ladies
In the school gym locker
And they find they were lookin' D
I was high school loser
Never made it with a lady
'Til a boy told me somethin' I missed
That my next door neighbor
Had a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl just a little kiss, like this
She starts swingin' with the boys in the school
With her feet flyin' up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a miss who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
She told me to
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Well just gimme a hand
No no no no no no no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Well like this

Title: Sabotage
Lyrics:
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my God, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's a sabotage
So, so, so, so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button?
But you, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on
'Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage
Why
Our backs are now against the wall?
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate
Lord, I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage

Title: Take My Breath Away
Lyrics:
Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching i keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
Take my breath away
Through the hourglass i saw you
in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed i called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am afraid
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Title: Better Man
Lyrics:
Waitin', watchin' the clock
It's four o'clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more... she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Oh
Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself, oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong, and waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Yeah
She loved him, yeah, she don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah, that's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man, can't find a better man, can't find a better man

Title: Ziggy Stardust
Lyrics:
Oh
Oh, yeah
Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band
Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
With just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Mm-hmm
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar

Title: Stupid Girl
Lyrics:
You pretend you're high
Pretend you're bored
Pretend you're anything
Just to be adored
And what you need
Is what you get
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in faith
Don't believe in anything
That you can't break
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had you wasted
All you had you wasted
What drives you on
Can drive you mad
A million lies to sell yourself
Is all you ever had
Don't believe in love
Don't believe in hate
Don't believe in anything
That you can't waste
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake it
Don't believe in fear
Don't believe in pain
Don't believe in anyone
That you can't tame
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
All you had you wasted
All you had you wasted
You stupid girl
You stupid girl
Can't believe you fake it
Can't believe you fake itYou stupid girl

Title: Subterranean Homesick Blues
Lyrics:
Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't tie no bows
Better stay away from those
That carry 'round a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
Ah, get sick, get well
Hang around an ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hangin' 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpools
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters
Ah, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna

And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

And all the things you do

Oh, what a thing to've done

Turn it into something beautiful

Title: Would I Lie To You
Lyrics:
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?
My friends - know what's in store.
I won't be here anymore.
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor.
Watch me walkin'.
Walkin' out the door.
Believe me - I'll make it make it
Believe me - I'll make it make it
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?
Tell you straight - no intervention.
To your face - no deception.
You're the biggest fake.
That much is true.
Had all I can take.
Now I'm leaving you
Believe me - I'll make it make it
Believe me - I'll make it make it
Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

Now would I say something that wasn't true?

Title: The Boys Light Up
Lyrics:
Let me tell you about my mountain home
Where all the ladies names are Joan
Where husbands work back late at night
Hopes are up for trousers down
With hostess on a business flight
Taxi in a Mercedes drive
I hope that driver's coming out alive
The garden is a dorsetted
That lady - she's so corseted
She's got 15 ways to lead that boy astray
He thinks he's one and only
But that lovely she's so lonely
She pumps him full of breakfast and she sends him on his way
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Silently she opens the drawer
Mother's little helper is coming out for more
Strategically positioned before the midday show
Her back is arched, those lips are parched
Repeated blow by blow
Later at the party all the MPs rave
About the hummers she's been giving
And the money that they save
To her it is skin lotion
For his promotion to
That flat in Surfer's Paradise with the ocean view
What a sing song dance
What a performance
What a cheap tent show
Oh no no no no no
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up
Then the boys light up - light up - light up

Title: Mr Brightside
Lyrics:
I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I never

Lyrics:
Walking 'round the room singing Stormy Weather
At Fifty Seven Mount Pleasant Street
Well it's the same room, but everything's different
You can fight the sleep, but not the dream
Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky
Well, there's a small boat made of china
It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece
Well, do I lie like a loungeroom lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released?
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather, the weather with you
Instrumental
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather, take the weather, the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather
Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go, always take the weather, take the weather, the weather with you

Then what makes it, then what makes it
Then what makes it, then what makes it
Then what makes love the exception?
So why, oh, why, oh

Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Cruisin' through the west side, we'll be checkin' the scene
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car

Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancin' and they're dancin' for me

Title: Mickey
Lyrics:
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey
Hey Mickey
You've been around all night, and that's a little long
You think you've got the right, but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight? So you can take me home Mickey?
'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please, baby don't
Every night you still leave me all alone Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey,
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Hey Mickey
Now when you take me by the hooves, who's ever gonna know
And every time you move I let a little more show
There's something you can use, so don't say no Mickey
So come on and give it to me anyway you can
Anyway you want to do it, I'll take it like a man
But please baby, please don't leave me in the damn Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey,
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey,
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand

Title: Teardrop
Lyrics:
Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath
Night, night after day
Black flowers blossom
Fearless on my breath
Black flowers blossom
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my...
Water is my eye
Most faithful mirror
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Of a confession
Fearless on my breath
Most faithful mirror
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath
You're stumbling in the dark
You're stumbling in the dark

Title: Lady In Red
Lyrics:
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
Looking for a little romance
Give'em half a chance
I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind
The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
And I hardly know
this beauty by my side
I'll never forget
the way you look tonight
I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
as I do tonight
The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
And I hardly know
this beauty by my side
I'll never forget
the way you look tonight
I never will forget
the way you look tonight
The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red
I love you

Title: 1979
Lyrics:
Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all
And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed
To the earth below
(...)
Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues down to see
That we don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see
That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess; forgotten and absorbed
To the earth below
The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around

Title: Power And The Passion
Lyrics:
People, wasting away in paradise
Going backward, once in a while
Moving ahead, falling behind
What do you believe, what do you believe
What do you believe is true
Nothing they say makes a difference this way
Nothing they say will do
You take all the trouble that you can afford
At least you won't have time to be bored
At least you won't have time to be bored
Oh the power and the passion, oh the temper of the time
Oh the power and the passion
Sometimes you've got to take the hardest line
Sunburnt faces around, with skin so brown
Smiling zinc cream and crowds, Sundays the beach never a cloud
Breathing eucalypt, pushing panel vans
Stuff and munch junk food
Laughing at the truth, cos Gough was tough til he hit the rough
Uncle Sam and John were quite enough
Too much of sunshine too much of sky
It's just enough to make you want to cry
It's just enough to make you want to cry
Oh the power and the passion, oh the temper of the time
Oh the power and the passion
Sometimes you've got to take the hardest line
I see buildings, clothing the sky, in paradise
Sydney, nights are warm
Daytime telly, blue rinse dawn
Dad's so bad he lives in the pub, it's a underarms and football clubs
Flat chat, Pine Gap, in every home a Big Mac
And no one goes outback, that's that
You take what you get and get what you please
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
Oh the power and the passion, oh the temper of the time
Oh the power and the passion
Sometimes you've got to take the hardest line

Title: The Real Slim Shady
Lyrics:
Eminem]
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes
[Chorus - Eminem (repeat 2x):]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?
[Eminem]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [AHHH!]
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*HACH*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus 4X]
[Eminem]
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

Title: Crazy Little Thing Called Love
Lyrics:
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing, this thing
Called love, called love
It cries like a baby
In a cradle all night
It swings, It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love

Title: Jackson
Lyrics:
We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson 
Ever since the fire went out.
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around,
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson,
Look out Jackson town.
Well, go on down to Jackson; go ahead and wreck your health.
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself,
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson.
See if I care.
When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow. (Hah!)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how,
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loosen my coat.
'Cos I'm goin' to Jackson.
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote.
But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg.
They'll lead you 'round town like a scalded hound,
With your tail tucked between your legs,
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man.
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Jaypan Fan.
Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out.
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact.
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back.
Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out...

Title: Heroes
Lyrics:
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day
And you, you could be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What'd you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing
nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying
then you better not stay
But we could be safer
just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
just for one day

Lyrics:
Good morning Miss, can I help you son?
Sixteen today and up for fun
I'm a big boy now or so they say
So if you'll serve I'll be on my way
Box of balloons with the feather-light touch
Pack of party-poppers that pop in the night
A toothbrush and hairspray, plastic grin
Miss Clay on all corners has just walked in
Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the house of fun
Welcome to the lion's den
Temptation's on his way
Welcome to the house of
No no no Miss, you misunderstood
Sixteen big boy, full pint in my manhood
I'm up to date and the date's today
So if you'll serve I'll be on my way
Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the lion's den
Temptation's on his way
Welcome to the house of fun
I'm sorry son but we don't stock
Party gimmicks in this shop
Try the house of fun, it's quicker if you run
This is a chemist's, not a joke shop
Party hats, simple enough clear
Comprehend savvy understand, do you hear?
A pack of party hats with the colored tips
Too late, gorgon heard gossip
Well, hello Joe, hello Miss Clay
Many happy returns from the day
Welcome to the house of fun
Now I've come of age
Welcome to the house of fun
Welcome to the lion's den

Title: Beautiful Day
Lyrics:
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace
It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
A beautiful day
Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
You don't need it now, you don't need it now
Beautiful day

Title: Another Day In Paradise
Lyrics:
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
He starts to whistle as he crosses the street
She's embarrassed to be there
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been cryin'
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's tryin'
Oh, just think twice, it's just another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, yes think twice, it's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, just think about it
Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say
You can tell by the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there
Oh, yes think twice, it's just another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, yes think twice, it's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, just think about it
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me in paradise
It's just another day
For you and me
It's another day
For you and me
It's another day
For you and me in paradise
In paradise

Title: Burning Down The House
Lyrics:
Get them out
Ah
Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house
Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has, got to be a way
Burning down the house
Here's your ticket pack your bags
Time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation isn't here
Close enough but not too far,
Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire, huah
All wet, hey you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred, sixty five degrees
Burning down the house
It was once upon a place sometimes, I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say baby what did you expect
Gonna burst into flame
Go ahead
Burning down the house
My house, is out of the ordinary
That's right, don't want to hurt nobody
Some things, sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house
No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fightin' fire with fire, huah
Yea
Burning down the house
Burning down the house
Burning down the house

Lyrics:
[Intro]
(For the other half of the sky)
[Verse 1]
Woman I can hardly express
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness
After all I'm forever in your debt
And woman I will try to express
My inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success
[Chorus]
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
[Verse 2]
Woman I know you understand
The little child inside of the man
Please remember my life is in your hands
And woman hold me close to your heart
However distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Woman please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again
[Outro]
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah

Title: Drop The Pilot
Lyrics:
I'm right on target, my aim is straight
So you're in love, I say what of it?
Things can change, there's always changes
I wanna try some rearranging, I say
Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
You're kissing cousins, there's no smoke, no flame
If you lose that pilot I can fly your plane
If you want solid ground, come on and try me
Oh I can take you so high that you're never gonna wanna come down, I say
Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
I said animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
I'm the one you need
Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm an easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
I say drop the pilot
Drop the monkey
Drop the mahout
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need
I'm the one you need
Drop the pilot

It still feels like our first night together.
Feels like the first kiss
It's getting better baby
No one can better this.
Still holding on
You're still the one.
First time our eyes met
Same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger
I wanna love you longer
Do you still turn the fire on?
So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love you a little more than I should
Please forgive me, I know not what I do.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do.
Please believe me, every word I say is true.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch
Still getting closer baby
Can't get closer enough
Still holding on
You're still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everything
I remember all your moves
I remember you yeah
I remember the nights, you know I still do.
So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love you a little more than I should
Please forgive me, I know not what I do.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do.
Oh believe me, every word I say is true.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
The one thing I'm sure of
Is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on
Is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm praying
That's why I'm saying...
Please forgive me, I know not what I do.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
Don't deny me, this pain I'm going through.
Please forgive me, if I need you like I do.
Babe, believe it, every word I say is true.
Please forgive me, if I can't stop loving you.
No, believe me, I don't know what I do.
Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you.
I can't stop loving you.

Title: Eternal Flame
Lyrics:
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlin'
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this burning an eternal flame
I believe it's meant to be, darlin'
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oh
Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oh
Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlin'
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this burning an eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlin'
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming, ah
An eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlin'
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming, ah
Is this burning an eternal flame
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darlin'

Title: Heaven
Lyrics:
You don't need no friends
Get back your faith again
You have the power to believe
Another dissident
Take back your evidence
It has no power to deceive
I'll believe it, when I see it for myself
I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive
Sit with them all night
Everything they say is right
But in the morning, they were wrong
I'll be right by your side
Come hell or water high
Down any road you choose to roam
I'll believe it, when I see it for myself
I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive, yeah
Darling I believe, oh
Sometimes it's hard to breathe, oh Lord
At the bottom of the sea, yeah yeah
I'll believe it, when I see it for myself
I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive
I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset
I can see the sunset
I can see the sunset
I don't need no one, oh yeah
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven, oh
I believe, yeah

Title: Beat It
Lyrics:
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight

Title: How To Make Gravy
Lyrics:
Hello Dan, it's Joe here, I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December, and now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behaviour, I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day, please don't let 'em cry for me
I guess the brothers are driving down from Queensland and Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees, even more maybe, but that won't stop the roast
Who's gonna make the gravy now? I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce for sweetness and that extra tang
And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly,
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her early Christmas morning
When I'm standing in line
I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend, I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
(Just a little too much cologne)
And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight
Oh praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas,
I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening, I can just imagine,
You'll put on Junior Murvin and push the tables back
And you'll dance with Rita, I know you really like her,
Just don't hold her too close, oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up,
Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact
You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me,
I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat
Tell her that I'm sorry, yeah I love her badly, tell 'em all I'm sorry,
and kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy,
I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back.

Title: Cornflake Girl
Lyrics:
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought it was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us the yo heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time
This is not really
This, this, this is not really happening
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword
She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopaedia
They must have paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
This is not really
This, this, this is not really happening
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, 
where'd you put the keys, girl
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah, yeah

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl, oh this time
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, oh yeah

Title: Howzat
Lyrics:
You told me I was the one
The only one who got your head undone
And for a while I believed the line that you spun
But I've been looking at you
Looking closely at the things you do
I didn't see it the way you wanted me to
How how howzat
You messed about
I caught you out
Howzat
Now that I found where you're at
It's goodbye
Well howzat
It's goodbye
You only came for a smile
Even though you're really not my style
I didn't think that you'd run me 'round
Like you do
How how howzat
You messed about
I caught you out
Howzat
Now that I found where you're at
It's goodbye
Well howzat
It's goodbye
Aha
O yeah, oh yeah
Well I've been looking at you
(I'll tell you what I see)
Looking closely at the things you do
(No you can't fool me)
I didn't see it the way you wanted me to
How how howzat
You messed about
I caught you out
Howzat
Now that I found where you're at
It's goodbye
Howzat
You messed about
I caught you out
Howzat
Now that I found where you're at
It's goodbye
Well howzat
Goodbye
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Title: Freedom
Lyrics:
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh, yeah
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
(Didn't know what I wanted to be)
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
(And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
(Rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom (Gotta have some faith in the sound)
You've gotta give for what you take (It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (So please don't give me up)
Freedom ('Cause I would really really love to stick around)
You've gotta give for what you take
Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
(What a kick just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
(We were living in a fantasy)
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
(Boys on MTV)
But today the way I play the game has got to change, oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll I be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom (Gotta have some faith in the sound)
You've gotta give for what you take
(It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (So please don't give me up)
Freedom ('Cause I would really really love to stick around)
You've gotta give for what you take
Well, it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass, they notice fast
And some mistakes were build to last
(That's what you get)
That's what you get
(That's what you get)
I say that's what you get
(That's what you get for changing your mind)
That's what you get for changing your mind
(That's what you get)
(That's what you get) And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah
Freedom (Oh)
Freedom
(My) Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom (I'll hold on to my freedom)
(My) Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Yeah
You've gotta give for what, give for what, give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live

Title: Rock The Casbah
Lyrics:
Now the King told the boogie man
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shakin' to the top
The Sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a-cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a-standing
On the radiator grille
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
By order of the Prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But Bedouins they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar picking thumb
As soon as the Sharif had cleared the square
They began to wail
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Now over at the temple
Oh, they really pack 'em in
The in-crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
Then the temple band took fire
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
The King called up his jet fighters
He said you better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the Minarets
Down the Casbah way
As soon as the Sharif was chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Sharif was outta their heir
The jet pilots wailed
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
He thinks it's not kosher
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
Fundamentally he can't take it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it
You know he really hates it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rockin' the Casbah
Sharif don't like it

Title: Honesty
Lyrics:
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe
Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me where else can I turn
Because you're the only one that I depend on
Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

Title: 1999
Lyrics:
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin'
Coulda sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple,
there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' 2 run from the destruction,
U know I didn't even care
'Cuz they say two thousand zero zero party over,
oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go 2 fast
But life is just a party, and parties weren't meant 2 last
War is all around us, my mind says prepare 2 fight
So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen 2 my body tonight
Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero party over,
oops out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah
Lemme tell ya somethin'
If U didn't come 2 party,
don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket,
and baby he's ready 2 roar
Yeah, everybody's got a bomb,
we could all die any day
But before I'll let that happen,
I'll dance my life away
Oh, they say two thousand zero zero party over,
oops out of time
We're runnin' outta time (Tonight I'm gonna)

Title: Come Away With Me
Lyrics:
Come away with me in the night
Come away with me
And I will write you a song
Come away with me on a bus
Come away where they can't tempt us
With their lies
And I wanna walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
So won't you try to come
Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountain top
Come away with me
And I'll never stop loving you
I wanna wake up with the rain
Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms
So all I ask is for you
To come away with me in the night
Come away with me

Title: Solid Rock
Lyrics:
Out here nothin' changes, not in a hurry anyway
You feel the endlessness with the comin' of the light of day
We're talkin' about a chosen place
You wouldn't sell it in a marketplace, well
Well just a minute now
Standing on solid rock
Standing on sacred ground
Living on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowin' down the line
Right down the line
Round about the dawn of time, when dreamin' all began
A croud of people came
Well they were looking for their promised land
Were running from the heart of darkness
Searching for the heart of light
Well it was their paradise
But they were standin' on solid rock
Standing on sacred ground
Living on borrowed time
And the winds of change were blowing cold that night
Oh
They were standin' on the shore one day, Saw the white sails in the sun
Wasn't long before they felt the sting, white man, white law, white gun
Don't tell me that it's justified, 'cause somewhere, someone lied
Yeah well someone lied, someone lied, genocide
Well someone lied, oh, ahh
And now you're standing on solid rock
Standing on a sacred ground
Living on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowin' down the line
Solid rock, Standing on sacred ground
Living on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowing down the line
Solid rock, Standing on sacred ground
Living on borrowed time
And the winds of change are blowing down the line
Oh-oh-oh no, no-oh

Lyrics:
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

Title: My Happiness
Lyrics:
I see your shadow on the street now
I hear you push through the rusty gate
Click of your heels on the concrete
Waiting for a knock, coming way too late
It seems an age since I've seen ya
Count down as the weeks trickle into days
So you come in and put your bags down
I know there's something in the air
How can I do this to you right now?
You're over there when I need you here...
My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go
It seems an age since I've seen ya
Count down as the weeks trickle into days
I hope that time hasn't changed ya
All I really want is for you to stay
So you come in and put your bags down
I notice something in the air
How can I do this to you right now?
You're over there when I need you here...
My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
Must be when you pack up and go
I know, I know, I know, what is inside
I know, I know, I know, what is inside
I know, I know, I know, what is inside
I know, I know, I know, what is inside
You're over there when I need you here...
My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
Must be when you pack up and go
My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
Must be when you pack up and go

Title: Here I Go Again
Lyrics:
I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
In songs of yesterday
An' I've made up my mind,
I ain't wasting no more time
Here I go again
Here I go again
Tho' I keep searching for an answer,
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on,
'Cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
An' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
An' I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
I'm just another heart in need of rescue,
Waiting on love's sweet charity
An' I'm gonna hold on
For the rest of my days,
'Cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
An' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
An' I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
But, here I go again,
Here I go again,
Here I go again,
Here I go
'Cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
An' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
An' I've made up my mind,
I ain't wasting no more time
An' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
'Cos I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
An' here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone

Title: Stand By Me
Lyrics:
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me
Stand by me
Darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me, oh won't you stand now, stand
Stand by me...

Title: I Want You
Lyrics:
Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain, I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball that
I need to, I want to
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell perfume, it's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction of a lover
And a mate but the time of talkin using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when I get to you
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain I just hold on tight
And if it happens again I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that I need to I want to
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
So can we find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you
But ooh, I'd die to find out

Title: Lady Writer
Lyrics:
Lady Writer on the TV
Talk about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectations left to come up to yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah, she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place
Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
You talked to me when you felt like it
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place
Yes and your rich old man
You know he'd call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus you mother was a jazz singer
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
Then I recall my fall from grace
Another time, another place
Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldn't hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the
Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me
And the lady writer on the TV
Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me
And the lady writer on the TV

Title: The Message
Lyrics:
[Intro]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 1]
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
[Hook]
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 2]
Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, living in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got social security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
[Hook]
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 3]
My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!
[Hook]
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 4]
My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money; ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun, 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say "You want some more?", living on a see-saw
[Hook]
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 5]
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say "I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool."
But then you wind up dropping outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so...
[Hook]
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Lyrics:
Little ditty bout jack and diane
Two American kids growin up in the heartland
Jacky's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante backseat of Jacky's car
Suckin' on chili dogs outside the tastee freeze

He's got his hand between her knees

Behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks
Let me do what I please.
And Jacky Say
Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin is gone
Oh yeay say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin is gone, they walk on

Scratches his head and does his best james dean.
Well you know diane, we oughtta run of the city

Long after the thrill of livin is gone
Oh yeay say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin is gone

Two american kids doing the best they can

Title: Kids In America
Lyrics:
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town
Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing
Will the kids in America (Whoa)
Will the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round
Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind
Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory
Will the kids in America (Whoa)
Will the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la
Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby
New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya
Will the kids in America (Whoa)
Will the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody lives for the music-go-round
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la (Sing)
La la la la-la la-a
La la la la-la la
Will the kids
Will the kids
Will the kids in America
Will the kids

Title: Sledgehammer
Lyrics:
you could have a steam train
if you'd just lay down your tracks
you could have an aeroplane flying
if you bring your blue sky back
all you do is call me
I'll be anything you need
you could have a big dipper
going up and down, all around the bends
you could have a bumper car, bumping
this amusement never ends
I want to be your sledgehammer
why don't you call my name
oh let me be your sledgehammer
this will be my testimony
show me round your fruitcage
'cos I will be your honey bee
open up your fruitcage
where the fruit is as sweet as can be
I want to be your sledgehammer
why don't you call my name
you'd better call the sledgehammer
put your mind at rest
I'm going to be-the sledgehammer
this can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
let there be no doubt about it
sledge sledge sledgehammer
I've kicked the habit
shed my skin
this is the new stuff
I go dancing in, we go dancing in
oh won't you show for me
and I will show for you
show for me, I will show for you
yea, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do mean you
only you

going to build that powerr

Title: Born To Try
Lyrics:
Doing everything that I believe in
Going by the rules that I've been taught
More understanding of what's around me
And protected from the walls of love
All that you see is me
And all I truly believe
That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try
No point in talking what you should have been
And regretting the things that went on
Life's full of mistakes, destinies and fate
Remove the clouds look at the bigger picture
And all that you see is me
And all I truly believe
That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try
All that you see is me
All I truly believe
All that you see is me
And all I truly believe
That I was born to try
I've learned to love
Be understanding
And believe in life
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try
But you've got to make choices
Be wrong or right
Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the things you like
But I was born to try

Lyrics:
We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
Ohh
We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all, yea
With so many light years to go and things to be found
(To be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown
The final countdown
The final countdown
(The final countdown)
Ohh ho ohh
The final countdown, oh ho
It's the final countdown
The final countdown

The final countdown
We'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown

Title: I Will Survive
Lyrics:
At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking, how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey, hey
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh
Go on now, go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one, who tried to break me with goodbye
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive

Title: Flame Trees
Lyrics:
Kids out driving Saturday afternoon just pass me by
I'm just savouring familiar sights
We shared some history, this town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotton feeling of her
Time to book a room and stay tonight.
Number one is to find some friends to say "You're doing wel..."
After all this time you boys look just the same."
Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels,
And settle in to play "Do you remember so and so?".
Number three is never say her name.
And Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace,
Everything within it's place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around.
But Oh! Who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway?
You know it takes more than just a memory to make me cry
And I'm happy just to sit here, at a table with old friends
And see which one of us can tell the biggest lies.
And there's a girl, she's falling in love, near where the pianola stands.
With a young local factory auto-worker, just holding hands
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay.
Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the field in our day
Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town.
There's no change, there's no pace,
Everything within it's place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around.
Oh the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town.
There's no change, there's no pace,
Everything within it's place
Just makes it harder to believe that she won't be around.

Title: Take A Chance On Me
Lyrics:
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(That's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me
We can go dancing, we can go walking
As long as we're together
Listen to some music, maybe just talking
Get to know you better
'Cos you know I've got
So much that I wanna do
When I dream I'm alone with you, it's magic
You want me to leave it there
Afraid of a love affair
But I think you know that I can't let go
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(Come on, give me a break will you?)
Take a chance on me
Oh, you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt meaby don't worry
I ain't gonna let you
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough
To last when things are rough, it's magic
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
No I can't let go, 'cos I love you so
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa ba-ba
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

Title: Straight Lines
Lyrics:
Breathing from a hole in my lung
I had no one
But faces in front of me
Racing through the void in my head
To find traces
Of a good luck academy
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
Sparks ignite and trade them for thought
About no one
And nothing in particular
Washed the sickened socket and drove
Resent nothing
There's good will inside of me
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
Wake me up lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately I'm a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line
Something I will never forget
I felt desperate
And stuck to the marrow
Invisible to everyone else
I'm a sex change
And a damsel with no heroine
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
Wake me up lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately I'm a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line
I don't need no time to say
There's no changing yesterday
If we keep talking and
I keep walking in straight lines
Wake me up lower the fever
Walking in a straight line
Set me on fire in the evening
Everything will be fine
Waking up strong in the morning
Walking in a straight line
Lately I'm a desperate believer
But walking in a straight line

Title: Under Pressure
Lyrics:
Pressure, pushing down on me,
pressing down on you, no man ask for.
Under pressure that burns a building down,
splits a family in two, puts people on streets.
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming, "let me out".
Tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor.
These are the days, it never rains but it pours.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming, "let me out".
Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high!
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Turned away from it all like a blind man.
Sat on a fence, but it don't work.
Keep comin' up with love, but it's so slashed and torn.
Why, why, why?
Love (love, love, love, love).
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking.
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love,
give love, give love, give love, give love, give love.
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word,
and love dares you to care for the people on the
edge of the night, and love dares you to
change our way of caring about ourselves.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves.
Under pressure.
Under pressure.
Pressure.

Title: Spicks And Specks
Lyrics:
Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet
Where are the girls
I left all behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where are the girls
I left all behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where is the girl i loved
All along
The girl that i loved
She's gone
She's gone
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life 've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life 've gone away
Spicks and specks!

Title: Taylor
Lyrics:
They say Taylor was a good girl
Never one to be late
Complain, express ideas in her brain
Working on the night shift
Passing out the tickets
You're gonna have to pay her, if you wanna park here
Well, mommy's little dancer has quite a little secret
Working on the streets now, never gonna keep it
It's quite an imposition and now she's only wishing
That she would have listened to the words they said
Poor Taylor
She just wanders around, unaffected by
The winter winds, and she'll pretend that
She's somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here
Well, Peter Patrick pitter-patters on the window
The sunny silhouette won't let him in
Poor old Pete's got nothing, cause he's been falling
Somehow, Sonny knows just where he's been
He thinks that singing on Sunday is gonna save his soul
Now that Saturday's gone
Sometimes he thinks that he's on his way
But I can see that his brake lights are on
He just wanders around, unaffected by the
Winter winds, and he'll pretend that
He's somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here
Such a tough enchilada, filled up with nada
Giving what she gotta give to get a dollar bill
Used to be a limber chicken, times have been a tickin'
Now she's finger lickin' to the man
With the money in his pocket, flying in his rocket
Only stopping by on his way to a better world
If Taylor finds a better world
Then Taylor's gonna run away

Title: Purple Rain
Lyrics:
I never meant to cause you
any sorrow
I never meant to cause you
any pain
I only wanted one time to see
you laughing
I only wanted to see you laughing
in the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
bathing
in the purple rain
I never wanted to be your
weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind
of friend, hey
Baby, I could never steal you
from another
It's such a shame our friendship
had to end
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
underneath the purple rain
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changin'
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you too
You say you want a leader
but you can't seem to make up
your mind
And I think you better close it
and let me guide you to
the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
If you know what I'm singin'
about up here, come on
raise your hand
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you
only want to see you in the
purple rain

Title: Ray Of Light
Lyrics:
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember
Where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as one
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone
And I feel...
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
She's flying
Quicker than a ray of light
I'm flying

Lyrics:

one love
One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children crying (One love)
Hear the children crying (One heart)
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right."
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?
Believe me
One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One love)
So shall it be in the end (One heart)
Alright, "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right."
"Let's get together and feel all right."
One more thing
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One love)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One song)
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation
Sayin', "One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right."
I'm pleading to mankind (One love)
Oh, Lord (One heart) Whoa.
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right.
Let's get together and feel all right.
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right.
Let's get together and feel all right.

Title: Ironic
Lyrics:
An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic... don't you think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
"Well isn't this nice..."
And isn't it ironic... don't you think
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face
A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic... don't you think
A little too ironic... and, yeah, I really do think...
It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures
Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out

Title: Simply Irresistible
Lyrics:
How can it be permissible
She compromise my principle, yeah yeah
That kind of love is mythical
She's anything but typical
She's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
She used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Her loving is so powerful, huh
It's simply unavoidable
The trend irreversible
The woman is invincible
She's a natural law, and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible
(She's all mine, there's no other way to go)
She's unavoidable, I'm backed against the wall
She gives me feelings like I never felt before
I'm breaking promises, she's breaking every law
She used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible
(She's all mine, there's no other way to go)
Her methodes are inscrutable
The proof is irrefutable, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's so completely kissable, huh
Our lives are indivisible, yeah yeah
She's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
She used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible
(She's all mine, there' no other way to go)
Simply irresistible

Title: (Everything I Do) I Do It For You
Lyrics:
Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me.
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there you'll search no more.
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for.
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for.
You know it's true:
Everything I do, I do it for you.
Look into your heart - you will find
There's nothin' there to hide.
Take me as I am, take my life.
I would give it all, I would sacrifice.
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true:
Everything I do, I do it for you, oh, yeah.
There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love.
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah.
Look into your heart, baby...
Oh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for.
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more.
Yeah, I would fight for you, I'd lie for you,
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you.
You know it's true:
Everything I do, oh, I do it for you.
Everything I do, darling.
You will see it's true.
You will see it's true.
Yeah!
Search your heart and your soul
You can't tell it's not worth dying for
I'll be there
I'd walk the fire for you
I'd die for you
Oh, yeah.
I'm going all the time, all the way.

Lyrics:
Hell is gone and heaven's here
There's nothing left for you to fear
Shake your arse come over here
Now scream
I'm a burning effigy
Of everything I used to be
You're my rock of empathy, my dear
So come on let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Life's too short for you to die
So grab yourself an alibi
Heaven knows your mother lied
Mon cher
Separate your right from wrongs
Come and sing a different song
The kettle's on so don't be long
Mon cher
So come on let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Look me up in the yellow pages
I will be your rock of ages
Your see through fads and your crazy phrases yeah
Little Bo Peep has lost his sheep
He popped a pill and fell asleep
The dew is wet but the grass is sweet, my dear
Your mind gets burned with the habits you've learned
But we're the generation that's got to be heard
You're tired of your teachers and your school's a drag
You're not going to end up like your mum and dad
So come on let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
He may be good he may be outta sight
But he can't be here so come around tonight
Here is the place where the feeling grows
You gotta get high before you taste the lows
So come on
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
So come on let me entertain me
Let me entertain you
Come on come on come on come on

Title: Come On Eileen
Lyrics:
Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them
You're grown, so grown
Now I must say more than ever, come on Eileen
Toora loora toora loo rye ay
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah come on Eileen
These people round here
Wear beaten down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces
So resigned to what their fate is
But not us, no never, no not us, no never
We are far too young and clever
Remember
Toora loora toora loo rye ay
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
Ah come on let's, take off everything
Pretty red dress, Eileen tell him yes
Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen
That pretty red dress, Eileen tell him yes
Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen, please
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(Now you have grown, now you have shown)
Toora toora, too loora
(Oh Eileen)
(Said come on)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(These things that are real so, how you feel)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(Now I must say more than ever)
Toora toora, too loora
(Things round here change)
(I said toora loora)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
(Toora loo rye ay)
Come on Eileen, too loo rye ay
Toora toora, too loora
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty, ah come on Eileen
Come on Eileen, oh I swear what he means
At this moment, you mean everything
In that dress oh my thoughts I confess
Well they're dirty, on Eileen
Come on Eileen, whoa what he means
Oh, ah come on, everything
{Oh believe me if all those endearing young chums
That I gaze on so firmly today
Were to suddenly leave you, oh fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky}

Get things done

But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for (modern love)
Walks beside me (modern love)
Walks on by (modern love)
Gets me to the church on time (church on time)
Terrifies me (church on time)

Don't believe in modern love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

Lyrics:
Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet
You want it all, but you can't have it
It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame
You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
(Girls in town)
Follow you
(Follow you)
All around
(All around)
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
(Girls in town)
Follow you
(Follow you)

Just like me, they long to be

When the samba takes you
Out of nowhere
And the backgrounds fading
Out of focus
Yes the picture changing
Every moment
And your destination
You don't know it
Avalon
When you bossa nova
There's no holding
Would you have me dancing
Out of nowhere
Avalon, Avalon, Avalon
Avalon, Avalon, Avalon

Title: Most People I Know
Lyrics:
Most people I know think that I'm crazy
And I know at times I act a little hazy
But if that's my way and you should know it then
In every way help me to show it
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
For most of my life I lived a delusion
Yes, material gain has caused me confusion
But slowly in time I learned that my place
Is to tell all that I meet the glory that god is
Ooh, yeah, yeah
And that's why
Most people I know think that I'm crazy
And I know at times I act a little hazy
But if that's my way and you should know it then
In every way help me to show it
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Most people I know think that I'm crazy
And I know at times I act a little hazy
But if that's my way and you should know it then
In every way help me to show it

Title: Fastlove
Lyrics:
Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby can't you read the signs?
I won't bore you with the details baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Lets just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right
But if youre looking for...
Fastlove,
Fastlove
in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
Some fastlove is all that Ive got on my mind
(Uuuuu)
Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
I just want to have some fun
I won't bore you with the details baby
You gotta get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
I aint Mr. Right
But if you're looking for...
Fastlove,
Fastove
in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad luck
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind
(Uuuuu) Baby, baby...
In the absence of security
Made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby, oh I...
I miss, I miss...
I miss my baby...
Oh, I...
I miss my baby.

Title: Fernando
Lyrics:
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute, seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...

Title: Tomorrow
Lyrics:
It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me but I'll ask anyway
Won't you come with me to a place in a little town
The only way to get there's to go straight down
There's no bathroom and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very hard to drink
Very hard to drink
You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow
You say that money isn't everything
But I'd like to see you live without it
You think you can keep on going, living like a king
Babe, but I strongly doubt it
Very hard to drink
Very hard to drink
You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow
You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow

Title: Money For Nothing
Lyrics:
Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
See the little faggot with the earring and the make-up
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's millionaire
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
I shoulda' learned to play the guitar
I shoulda' learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free
We gotta install ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's, Lord
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' get your chicks for free
Money for nothin' get chicks for free

Title: All I Wanna Do
Lyrics:
Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.
"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me
'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Title: Whip It
Lyrics:
Crack That Whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back
When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it
Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good
When a good time turns around
You must whip it
You will never live it down
Unless you whip it
No one gets away
Until they whip it
I say whip it
Whip it good
I say whip it
Whip it good
Crack that whip
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back
When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sits out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it
Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good

Title: Brick
Lyrics:
Six a.m. day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold
Car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping
I am numb
Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
They call her name at seven-thirty
I pace around the parking lot
And I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Then she ever has before
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
As weeks went by
It showed that she was not fine
They told me, "Son it's time to tell the truth," and
She broke down and I broke down
Cause I was tired of lying
Driving back to her apartment
For the moment we're alone
Yeah she's alone
And I'm alone
Now I know it
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drownin' slowly

Title: Before Too Long
Lyrics:
Before too long
The one that you're loving
Will wish that he'd never met you
Before too long
He who is nothing
Will suddenly come into view
So let the time keep rolling on
It's on my side
Lonely nights will soon be gone
High is the tide
Before too long
We'll be together
And no-one will tear us apart
Before too long
The words will be spoken
I know all the action by heart
As the night time follows day
I'm closing in
Every dog will have his day
Any dog can win
Shut the shade do not fear anymore
Here I come creeping round your back door
Before too long
I'll be repeating
What's happened before in my mind
Before too long
Over and over
Just like a hammer inside
As the nighttime follows day
I'm closing in
Every dog will have his day
Any dog can win
Before too long
Before too long

Title: Give It Away
Lyrics:
What I've got, you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got, you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop continue
Realize, I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me say hell yes
I'm a low brow, but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart, get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time, than right now
Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley, taught me how to off it
Bob Marley, walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
Lucky me, swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up, from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times, when she scrub me
Feelin' good, my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice, young love chug-a-lug me
There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody, time to deliver
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
What I've got, you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got, you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop continue
Realize, I don't want to be a miser
Confide wisely, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away now

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

The youthful heart can love you
Yes and give you what you need

Oh and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy
Give me one reason to stay here

Oh give me just one reason why I should stay
Said I told you I loved you

Title: Hurricane
Lyrics:
Pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all!"
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops
"One of us had better call up the cops"
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates"
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
"Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?"
"Don't forget that you are white"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said:"I'm really not sure"
Cops said:"A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman jim"
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder "one," guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Title: Mysterious Ways
Lyrics:
Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand
Love
She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy
She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, love
One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held
How by this love while you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Love, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
We move through miracle days
Move you, spirit, move, making love
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Yeah, move, yeah, move, make love
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
You move with it, she moves with it
It's alright, it's alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, love

Title: History Never Repeats
Lyrics:
History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
Don't say the words you might regret
I lost before, you know I can't forget
There was a girl I used to know
She dealt my love a savage blow
I was so young, too blind to see
But anyway that's history
I say history never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
Don't say the words you might regret
I lost before, you know I can't forget
You say I always play the fool
I can't go on if that's the rule
Better to jump than hesitate
I need a change and I can't wait
History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart, ah
History never repeats
History never repeats
Deep in the night it's all so clear
I lie awake with great ideas
Lurking about in no-man's land
I think at last I understand
History never repeats
I tell myself before I go to sleep
And there's a light shining in the dark
Leading me on towards a change of heart, ah
Never repeats
Never repeats
Never repeats
Hey hey
Hey
Never repeats

Title: American Idiot
Lyrics:
Don't want to be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now, everybody, do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Don't want to be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Title: Killing Me Softly
Lyrics:
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
(Ah!) Yooo! (Yeah! Yeah!)
This is Wyclef, Refugee Camp (L-Boogie up in here)
Prazrel, (Prazrel up in here! Ha! Ha!)
Lil' Base sits up there on the base (Refugees up in here)
While I'm on this... I got my girl L (Ah! Ah!)
One time, one time, (one time)
Ayo, L, you know you got the lyrics
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was
This young boy, stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers 
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words 
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with this song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
Then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers 
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words 
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Yo, L-Boy, take it to the bridge

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain yeah
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words

Title: In The Air Tonight
Lyrics:
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin,
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget,
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up,
No you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Title: Scar
Lyrics:
He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said "use these down to your bones"
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought "this one knows better than I do"
A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit
And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
So the next one came with a bag of treats,
she smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one,
looked at my insides clicking
her tongue and said "This will all have to come undone"
A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit
And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cos I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody
buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?
And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
Could you leave me with a scar?

Title: What Have You Done For Me Lately
Lyrics:
Spoken intro:
What's up girl?
He stood me up again
Again?
Mmhmm
Well what's up with this guy?
Do you really like him that much?
Yes honey, I love him, he is fine,
he does a lot of nice things for me I know he used to do nice stuff for you,
but what has he done for you lately?)
Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dancin' 'til I thought I'd lose my breath
Ahh
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death
Ain't that a shame?
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm tellin' you, no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things,
but little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we can do today
Soap opera says, you've got one life to live
Who's right, who's wrong?
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
Get with it
Uh, let me know, and from the front
Let me know, and let me know from the
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah (yeah ha)
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah (yeah)
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah (yeah)
(No oh oh, no oh, yeah, mmmhmm
Da di da di, da di da da
Da
Mmmhmm
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah ha ha, hey
Mmmhmm, yeah ha ha)
What have you done for me lately? (lately)
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
(Uh, uh, uh, da di di da, di da di da, a di do da da, yeah)
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately? (lately)
This is wild, I swear

Title: Whatever You Want
Lyrics:
Whatever you want
Whatever you like
Whatever you say
You pay your money
You take your choice
Whatever you need
Whatever you use
Whatever you win
Whatever you lose
You're showing off
You're showing out
You look for trouble
Turn around
Give me a shout
I take it all
You squeeze me dry
And now today
You couldn't even say goodbye
I could take you home
On the midnight train again
I could make an offer you can't refuse
Whatever you want
Whatever you like
Whatever you say
You pay your money
You take your choice
Whatever you need
Whatever you use
Whatever you win
Whatever you lose
You're showing off
You're showing out
You look for trouble
Turn around
Give me a shout
I take it all
You squeeze me dry
And now today
You couldn't even say goodbye
I could take you home
On the midnight train again
I could make an offer you can't refuse
Whatever you want
Whatever you like
Whatever you say
You pay your money
You take your choice
Whatever you need
Whatever you use
Whatever you win
Whatever you lose
Whatever you want

Title: Gold Digger
Lyrics:
She take my money when I'm in need
Yea she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you ROC, I can tell by ya charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by ya charm and ya arm
But I'm lookin' for the one
Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to showbiz
Ok, get yo' kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you betta be payed
You know why?
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
I don't care what none of ya'll say I still love her
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head
18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than he is
You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was spose' to buy ya shorty Tyco with ya money
She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money
She walkin' around lookin' like Micheal with ya money
Should of got that insured Geico for ya money
If you ain't no punk holla, "We want prenup"
"We want prenup!", yeaah
It's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo' ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head
Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know this dude's ballin' but yea that's nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin'
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo' ass for a white girl
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head
Let me hear that back

Title: Luka
Lyrics:
My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before
If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's cause I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud
They only hit until you cry
And after that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
Yes I think I'm okay
I walked into the door again
Well, if you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway
I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes I think you've seen me before
If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
I think it's because I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud
They only hit until you cry
And after that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore

Title: Thank You
Lyrics:
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it' d all be grey
But your picture on my wall it reminds me
That it's not so bad, it's not so bad
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad
And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life
Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, I wouldn't have a clue because you're
Near me
And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life
Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life
And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life
Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life
And I want to thank you for giving me
The best day of my life
Ohh, just to be with you is having
The best day of my life

Title: Jealous Guy
Lyrics:
I was dreamin' of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't know to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was trying to catch your eyes
Thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
Oh no, I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy, watch out
I'm just a jealous guy, look out, babe
I'm just a jealous guy

Title: The Boys Are Back In Town
Lyrics:
Guess who just got back today
Them wild-eyed boys that have been away
Haven't changed that much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told 'em you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
I said the boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
You know that chick that used to dance a lot
Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she'd got
Man when I tell you she was cool she was red hot
I mean, she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
I said the boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
Just spread the word around
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's Bar 'n' Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song
The nights are getting longer, it won't be long
Won't be long till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
Spread the word around
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back. The boys are back
The boys are back in town again
Been hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again

Title: Smooth Operator
Lyrics:
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jewel box life diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
Heaven help him, when he falls
Diamond life, lover boy
He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator

Title: Hello
Lyrics:
I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams
I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello
I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you
Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

She's holdin' legs, wonderin' how to feel them
Would you get behind them if you could only find them?
She's my baby, she's my baby
Yeah, it's alright, oh yeah
She's got hair down to her fanny
She's kinda jet set, try undo her panties
Every time she's dancin' she knows what to do
Everybody wants to see, to see if she can use it
She's so fine, she's all mine
Girl, you got it right
She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's got a dime, all of the time
Stays out at night, movin' through time
Oh, I want her, sure, I got to have her
The girl is alright, she's alright

Title: Once In A Lifetime
Lyrics:
You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
You may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
You may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"
And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving and water removing
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Leting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
You may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"
You may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"
You may ask yourself, "Am I right, am I wrong?"
You may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?"
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, look where my hand was
Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, hey let's all twist our thumbs
Here comes the twister
Letting the days go by
Letting the days go by
Once in a lifetime
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by

Title: Africa
Lyrics:
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12: 30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Title: Personal Jesus
Lyrics:
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
Take second best, put me to the test
Things on your chest, you need to confess
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Reach out and touch faith

Title: My Heart Will Go On
Lyrics:
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you, go on
Far across the distance
And spaces, between us
You have come to show you, go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does, go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on, and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a life time
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time, I hold to
In my life we'll always, go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does, go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll, stay, forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will, go on and on

Title: Money
Lyrics:
Money
Get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money
It's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car caviar four star daydream think I'll buy me a football team
Money
Well get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
M-o-n-e-y
It's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high fidelity first class travelling set and think I need a Lear jet
Money
It's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
M-o-n-e-y
So they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're giving none away
Away away way away away away away woo...
I was in the right yes absolutely
I certainly was in the right
That geezer was cruising for a bruising
Woo-woo...
Yeah
I don't know I was really drunk at the time
I was just telling him he couldn't get into number 2
He was asking why he wasn't coming up on freely?
After I was yelling and screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely

Title: Wicked Game
Lyrics:
The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you
And I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
The world was on fire, no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I...
(This world is only gonna break your heart)

Title: I Was Only 19
Lyrics:
Mum and Dad and Danny saw the passing out parade at Puckapunyal 
It was a long march from cadets
The sixth battalion was the next to tour and it was me who drew the card
We did Canungra and Shoalwater before we left
And Townsville lined the footpaths as we marched down to the quay
This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean
And there's me in me slouch hat with me SLR and greens
God help me - I was only nineteen
From Vung Tau riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
And we made our tents a home, V.B. and pinups on the lockers
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub
And can you tell me, doctor, why i still can't get to sleep?
And night time's just a jungle dark and a barking M.16? 
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me - I was only nineteen
A four week operation, when each step can mean your last one on two legs
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought about somethin' else
And then someone yelled out "Contact", another bloke swore
We hooked in there for hours, then a God almighty roar
And Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon
God help me - he was goin' home in June
And I can still see Frankie, drinkin' tinnies in the Grand Hotel 
On a thirty-six hour rec. leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle
'Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row
And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real.
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel
God help me, I was only nineteen.

Title: By My Side
Lyrics:
In the dark of the night
Those small hours
Uncertain and anxious
I need to call you
Rooms full of strangers
Some call me friend
But I wish you were
So close to me
In the dark of night
Those small hours
I drift away
When I'm with you
In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were
Here comes the clown
His face is a wall
No window
No air at all
In the dark of night
Those faces they haunt me
But I wish you were
So close to me
In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were
In the dark of night
By my side
In the dark of night
By my side
I wish you were
I wish you were
In the dark of night
Those faces they haunt me
I wish you were
So close to me
Yes I wish you were
By my side

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy.
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love be everything that you need.
I love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do.

And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky

The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty.

The highest powers. In lonely hours. The tears devour you.
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea.

I wanna live like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me...

Title: Passenger
Lyrics:
Caged
Hold so tight until your knuckles show
Escape
As far away as you could ever know
You sink them all down
Watch them float up
'til the wheel has spun around
You will
Be bound by what you are
Stand in the corner, with your face stripped of colour
For what?
If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
Step outside and see
Another world
Only if you want to be a passenger
Chained
So many places you'd prefer to be
than framed
By a picket fence and salary
You sink them all down
Then watch them float up
Until the
Wheel has spun around
You will be bound by who you are
tied to the corner
With your
Hope twisted under
In knots
If you want to be a passenger
Climb aboard with me we're leaving now
step outside and see another world
Only if you want to be a passenger

Title: Common People
Lyrics:
She came from Greece
She had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martins College
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, "Well, in that case I'll have a rum and Coca-Cola"
She said, "Fine"
And then in thirty seconds' time, she said
"I want to live like common people
I want to do whatever common people do
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you."
Well, what else could I do?
I said "Oh, I'll see what I can do."
I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said, "Pretend you've got no money."
And she just laughed and said, "Oh, you're so funny."
I said "Yeah?
Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here
Are you sure
You want to live like common people
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people
You want to sleep with common people like me?"
But she didn't understand
She just smiled and held my hand
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cos when you're laying in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all
Yeah
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor is cool
Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you
Look out
They'll tear your insides out
'cos everybody hates a tourist
Especially one who thinks it's
All such a laugh
Yeah and the chip stains and grease will come out in the bath
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why
Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cos when you're laying in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your Dad he could stop it all
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do what common people do
You'll never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you

Title: House Of The Rising Sun
Lyrics:
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one
My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when, he's on, a drug
Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one

Title: Loser
Lyrics:
In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double-barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phoney gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
That's chokin' on the splinters
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheeze whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body-pierce)
Yo, bring it on down
Soy
(backwards)
(I'm a driver, I'm a winner)
(Things are gonna change I can feel it)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen Sie deutsch, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Title: I Wanna Dance With Somebody
Lyrics:
Huh, yeah, woo, hey yeah, huh
Ooh yeah, uh huh, yeah
I want to dance
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who somebody who... somebody who loves me,
Somebody who somebody who... to hold me in his arms.
I need a man who'll take a chance,
On a love that burns hot enough to last.
So when the night falls,
My lonely heart calls.
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Uh-Huh

Common, baby

Woo, yeah

Now get with this, hahaha
Whoa, oh, oh
Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me baby?
Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me boy?
Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me baby?
With somebody who loves me
Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance?

Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance?

Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance...(Dance)

Title: Lightning Crashes
Lyrics:
Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes
The confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door
Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes
The confusion that was hers
Belongs now, to the baby down the hall
Oh now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
Lightning crashes, a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes
Pale blue colored iris, presents the circle
And puts the glory out to hide, hide
Oh now feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it

Title: Heart Of Glass
Lyrics:
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between 'what I find is pleasing' and 'I'm feeling fine'
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion
And I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using
Please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out was a pain the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa
Ooh ooh whoa

Title: Paranoid Android
Lyrics:
Please could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken
Voices in my head
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's there?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?

Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height

Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height

Rain down, rain down

The dust and the screaming
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit
The panic, the vomit
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah

Title: Lust For Life
Lyrics:
Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And a flesh machine
He's gonna do another strip tease
Hey man, where'd y'get that lotion?
I've been hurting since I'm up again
About something called love
Yeah, something called love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens
Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
I have a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life
I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a GTO
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With liquor and drugs
With liquor and drugs
Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
Well, I've a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Oh, a lust for life
Oh, a lust for life
A lust for life
I got a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in my ear before
Well, I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life
Well, here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And a flesh machine
I know he's gonna do another strip tease
Hey man, where'd y'get that lotion?
Your skin starts itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Love, love, love
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens
Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
And I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life
Got a lust for life
Yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Got a lust for life
Yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life

And I know baby just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real

Title: My Hero
Lyrics:
Too alarming now to talk about.
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, and race it around
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
Kudos my hero leaving all the best
You know my hero, the one that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Title: Pump It Up
Lyrics:
I've been on tenterhooks
Ending in dirty looks
Listening to the muzak
Thinking 'bout this and that
She said "that's that"
I don't wanna chitter-chat
Turn it down a little bit
Or turn it down flat
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Down in the pleasure centre
Hell-bent or heaven-sent
Listen to the propaganda
Listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand
That she wouldn't understand
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Hey!
She's been a bad girl
She's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it
She's like a narcotic
You wanna torture her
You wanna talk to her
All the things you bought for her
Could not get a temperature
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Out in the fashion show
Down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out
Under the pressure pin
Fall into submission
Hit and run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it

Title: Paranoid
Lyrics:
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind.
People think I'm insane, because I am frowning all the time.
All day long I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy.
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah.
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find.
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind.
Make a joke, and I will sigh, and you will laugh, and I will cry.
Happiness I cannot feel, and love to me is so unreal.
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state.
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late.

Title: Prisoner Of Society
Lyrics:
Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do
We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
The past is in your head
The future's in our hands
'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening
To anything you say
And if you count to three (one two three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society
Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do
'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening
To anything you say
And if you count to three (one two three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society
Well we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do
We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
So we don't need no one like you
To tell us what to do
Cos I'm a brat
And I know everything
And I talk back
Cos I'm not listening
To anything you say
And if you count to three
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society society society society

Title: Pressure Down
Lyrics:
Set the wheels in motion, and watch them turning round
I want to sail across the ocean, I've grown weary of this town
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, It's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
In this city full of danger, we lead our separate lives
And I was frightened by a stranger, with desperation in her eyes
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Someone turned the pressure on
I called your name and you were gone
And I was trapped like a prisoner in this lonely town
I'm gonna let things slide, until the pressure comes down
Oh the winner tells his story, the loser hides in shame
The winner steals the glory, while the loser takes the pain
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down
Take the pressure down
Cause I can feel it, it's rising like a storm
Take hold of the wheels and turn them around
Take the pressure down

Title: Hurt
Lyrics:
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

Title: Cosmic Girl
Lyrics:
I must've died and gone to heaven
'Cause it was quarter past eleven
On a Saturday in 1999
Right across from where I'm standing
On the dance floor she was landing
It was clear that she was from another time
Like some baby Barbarella
With the stars as her umbrella
She asked me if I'd like to magnetize
Do I have to go star-trekking
'Cause it's you I should be checking
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic
I'm scanning all my radars
Well she said she's from a quasar
Forty thousand million light years away
It's a distant solar system
Tried to phone but they don't list 'em
So I asked her for her number all the same
She said, "step in my transporter
So I can teleport ya
All around my heavenly body"
Oh, This could be a close encounter
I should take care not to flounder
Sends me into hyperspace
when I see her pretty face
She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
My heart's at zero gravity
She's from a cosmic world
Putting me in ecstasy
Transmitting on my frequency
She's cosmic
Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face... She's just a cosmic girl
From another galaxy
Transmitting on my frequency
Yeah cosmic, oh
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
I need you, I want you
To be my cosmic girl, for the rest of time
Oh, I'm loosing my love
Oh, my cosmic girl yeah
She, Incomprehensible

Title: Walk Like An Egyptian
Lyrics:
All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know
If they move too quick (oh way oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh way oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh way oh)
You drop your drink
Then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh way oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian
All the kids in the marketplace say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Slide your feet up the street
Bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh way oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh way oh)
They spin the clubs cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh way oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian
All the cops in the donut shop say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian

Lyrics:
If a boy had a chance, a chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart, let him cry for the moon
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes? (behind those eyes)
I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue (on my knees)
On my knees, help me baby,
Tell me what can I do, electric blue
Oh I had a dream, for a moment I believed it was true
Oh I'd have given anything just to be there with you
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes? (behind those eyes)
I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue (in too deep)
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two, electric blue (I can see)
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you, electric blue (on my knees)
On my knees, help me baby,
Tell me what can I do, electric blue
(Help me baby)
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
(behind those eyes)
I just freeze every time you see through me
And it's all over you, electric blue (in too deep)
In too deep, standing here waiting
As I'm breaking in two, electric blue (I can see)
I can see, can see that it may be
Just a vision of you, electric blue (on my knees)
On my knees, help me baby,
Tell me what can I do, electric blue (behind those eyes)

Title: Toy Soldiers
Lyrics:
(Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers)
It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way
What can I say
It's true, I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay
When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes, takes the fall
(Won't you come out and play with me)
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For Toy soldiers
It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop, the next one's gonna be me
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all, all the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me)
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For Toy soldiers
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all, all the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me)
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For Toy soldiers

Title: Blue Monday
Lyrics:
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now, how do I feel
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me just how I should feel today
I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel
Tell me now, how should I feel
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to leave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold, grows cold, cold

Title: The Look
Lyrics:
Walking like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look
Heavenly bound
'Cause heaven's got a number
When she's spinnin' me around
Kissin' is a colour
Her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
Fire in the ice
Naked to the T-bone
Is a lover's disguise
Bangin' on the head drum
Shakin' like a mad bull
She's got the look
Swayin' to the band
Movin' like a hammer
She's a miracle man
Lovin' is the ocean
Kissin' is the wet sand
She's got the look
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
She's got the look
Walkin' like a man
Hittin' like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look
And she goes

Title: Here Comes The Rain Again
Lyrics:
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do
Here comes the rain again
Raining in my hand like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do
So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Here comes again
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
Here it goes again, here it goes again
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
want to dive into your ocean
Is it rainin' with you?
Here comes the rain again
falling on my head like a memory
falling on my head like e new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
Here comes the rain again...

Title: Times Like These
Lyrics:
I am a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away
Then follows you back home
I am a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Burning off alone
Aah
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
I am a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight
I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?
Aah
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

Title: Better Be Home Soon
Lyrics:
Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever
And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert
And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
So don't say no
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause when you get back home
Maybe I'll be gone, oh
It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it
And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
Oh, that's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Title: Honky Tonk Woman
Lyrics:
I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in memphis,
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride.
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
cause I just cant seem to drink you off my mind.
Its the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
I laid a divorcee in new york city,
I had to put up some kind of a fight.
The lady then she covered me with roses,
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind.
Its the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
(yeah!) its the honky tonk women.
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues.
(yeah!) its the honky tonk women.
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Title: Never Ever
Lyrics:
A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention?
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face or even on the phone
You can write it in a letter, either way, I have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way, I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions
I have to find
My head's spinning
Boy, I'm in a daze
I feel isolated
Don't wanna communicate
I'll take a shower, I will scour
I will rub
To find peace of mind
The happy mind I once owned, yeah
Flexing vocabulary runs right through me
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
I'm not crazy
I'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong, no
I'm just waiting
Cause I heard that this feeling
Won't last that long
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole?
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling yeah, you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling, yeah, I just don't feel right
I'll keep searching
Deep within my soul
For all the answers
Don't wanna hurt no more
I need peace, got to feel at ease
Need to be
Free from pain - going insane
My heart aches, yeah
Sometimes vocabulary runs through my head
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
I'm not crazy
I'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just waiting
Cause I heard that this feeling won't last that long
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When ya gonna take me out of this black hole?
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling yeah, you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling, yeah, I just don't feel right
You can tell me to my face
You can tell me on the phone
Uh, you can write it in a letter, babe
Cause I really need to know
You can write it in a letter, babe
You can write it in a letter, babe

Title: Hold The Line
Lyrics:
It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you'll stay till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah
It's not in the words that you told me... Babe
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time, Love isn't always on time

Title: When The War Is Over
Lyrics:
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
When the war is over
Got to get away
Pack my bag to no place
In no time no day
You and I we used each other's shoulder
Still so young but somehow so much older
How can I go home and not get
Blown away
You and I had our sights set
On something
Hope this doesn't mean our days are numbered
I got plans for more than a wanted man
All around this chaos and madness
Can't help feeling nothing more than sadness
Only choice to face it the best I can
When the war is over
Got to start again
Try to hold a trace of what it was
Back then
You and I we sent each other stories
Just a page I'm lost in all its glory
How can I go home and not get blown away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away
Ain't nobody gonna steal this heart away

Title: With Or Without You
Lyrics:
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you

Title: Total Eclipse Of The Heart
Lyrics:
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes
(Turn around, bright eyes!) Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes!) Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit angry
And I know I've got to get out and cry
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes
(Turn around, bright eyes!) Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around, bright eyes!) Every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's going to start tonight
Forever's going to start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
(Turn around, bright eyes)
(Turn around, bright eyes)
Turn around, every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be
Turn around, every now then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around, every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wondrous as you
Turn around, every now and then I know there's nothing any better
And there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's going to start tonight
Forever's going to start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
Turn around bright eyes

Lyrics:
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat incomplete

When your heart beats next to mine
Gonna give you all my love boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong yeah you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah your love thawed out what was getting cold
Like a virgin

With your heart beat next to mine
Whoa oh-oh-oh

Title: Run To Paradise
Lyrics:
Baby, you were always gonna be the one
You only ever did it just for fun
But you run to paradise
Jenny, I'll meet you at the grocery store
You don't need a friend when you can score
You run to paradise
Johnny, we were always best of friends
Stick together and defend
But you run to paradise
And mamma, now don't you worry 'bout me anymore
And I see you crying at the door
When I run to paradise
That's right, they had it all worked out
You were young and blonde
And you could never do wrong
That's right, they were so surprised
You opened their eyes up
(Opened their eyes up)
Opened their eyes up
You don't want anyone
(You don't, you don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, you're no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, open your eyes up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, you're no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
Good times, why'd I let 'em slip away
Why'd I let them slip away
'Cause I lived in paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise
Run to paradise
Jesus says it's gonna be alright
He's gonna pat my back
So I can walk in the light (that's right)
You don't mind if I abuse myself
So I can hold my head up
(Hold my head up)
Hold my head up
You don't want anyone
(You don't, hold my head up)
You don't want anyone
(You don't, you're no fool)
Don't tell me, this is paradise
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
(Open your eyes up)
You don't need anyone
You'll tell me, this is paradise

Karma police
Arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself del

Title: Grace
Lyrics:
There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Oh, it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time
Of time
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Fire
And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow
Oh my love
And the rain is falling and I believe
My time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave
Leave behind
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Fire
It reminds me of the pain I might leave
Leave behind
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow, ohh
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Wait in the fire
Wa-wa-wait in the fire...

Title: Are You Gonna Go My Way
Lyrics:
I was born... long ago
I am the chosen, I'm the one
I have come... to save the day
And I won't leave until I'm done
So that's why... you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid... I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done
But what I really want to know is
Are you gonna go my way?
And I got to, got to know, eh
I don't know why... we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage... and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why... we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug... and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love
But what I really want to know is
Are you gonna go my way?
And I got to, got to know.
Are you gonna go my way?
'Cause, baby, I got to know, yeah

Title: Morning Glory
Lyrics:
All your dreams are made, when you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade.
Today's the day that all the world will see.
Another sunny afternoon.
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune; tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know
too soon.
Need a little time to wake up.
Need a little time to wake up, wake up.
Need a little time to wake up.
Need a little time to rest your mind; you know you should so I guess you might as
well.
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
You need a little time to wake up, wake up.
Well?
What's the story morning glory?
Well?
Need a little time to wake up, wake up.
All your dreams are made, when you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade.
Today's the day that all the world will see.
Another sunny afternoon.
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune; tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know
too soon.
Need a little time to wake up.
Need a little time to wake up, wake up.
Need a little time to wake up.
Need a little time to rest your mind; you know you should so I guess you might as

What's the story morning glory? Well?
Need a little time to wake up, wake up.
Well?
What's the story morning glory? Well?
You need a little time to wake up, wake up.

What's the story morning glory? Well?
Need a little time to wake up, wake up.

He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?

Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats - intimidations

Title: Hurts So Good
Lyrics:
When I was a young boy
Said put away those young boy ways
Now that I'm gettin' older, so much older
I love all those young boy days.
With a girl like you
With a girl like you
Lord knows there are things we can do, baby
Just me and you.
Come on and make it
Hurt so good.
Come on baby, make it hurt so good.
Sometimes love don't feel like it should.
You make it hurt so good.
Don't have to be so exiting.
Just tryin' to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah.
You always look so invitin'
You ain't as green as you are young
Hey baby, its you.
Come on, girl, now, its you.
Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby.
Let's see what we can do.
Come on and make it
Hurt so good.
Come on baby, make it hurt so good.
Sometimes love don't feel like it should.
You make it hurt so good.
I ain't talkin' no big deals
I ain't made no plans myself.
I ain't talkin' no high heels
Maybe we could walk around all day long
walk around all day long.
Hurt so good.
Come on baby, make it hurt so good.
Sometimes love don't feel like it should.
You make it hurt so good.
Hurt so good.
Come on baby, make it hurt so good.
Sometimes love don't feel like it should.
You make it hurt so good.
Hey, hey

Title: Poison
Lyrics:
You're a cruel device
Your blood
Like ice
One look
Could kill
My pain
Your thrill
I wanna love you
But I better not touch
(Don't touch)
I wanna hold you
But my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you
But I want it too much
(Too much)
I wanna taste you
But your lips are venomous
Poison
You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Your mouth
So hot
Your web
I'm caught
Your skin
So wet
Black lace
On sweat
I hear you calling
And it's needles and pins
(And pins)
I wanna hurt you
Just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you
But you're under my skin
(Deep in)
I wanna kiss you
But your lips are venomous
Poison
You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
One look
(One look)
Could kill
(Could kill)
My pain
Your thrill
I wanna love you
But I better not touch
(Don't touch)
I wanna hold you
But my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you
But I want it too much
(Too much)
I wanna taste you
But your lips are venomous
Poison
You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
I wanna love you
But I better not touch
(Don't touch)
I wanna hold you
But my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you
But I want it too much
(Too much)
I wanna taste you
But your lips are venomous
Poison
Yeah, well
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
Runnin' deep inside my veins
Burnin' deep inside my brain
Poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Title: Everlong
Lyrics:
Hello,
I've waited here for you...
Everlong.
Tonight,
I throw myself into,
And out of the red, out of her head she sang.
Come down
And waste away with me,
Down with me...
Slow how,
You wanted it to be,
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang.
And I wonder when I sing along with you,
If everything could ever feel this real forever.
If anything could ever be this good again,
The only thing I'll ever ask of you.
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
She sang:
Breathe out,
So I can breathe you in,
Hold you in,
And now,
I know you've always been there
Out of your head, out of my head I sang.
And I wonder when I sing along with you,
If everything could ever feel this real forever,
If anything could ever be this good again.
The only thing I'll ever ask of you,
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
She sang:
And I wonder...
If everything could ever feel this real forever,
If anything could ever be this good again.
The only thing I'll ever ask of you,
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.

Title: Pride
Lyrics:
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love

Lyrics:
And you can dance for inspiration
Come on, I'm waiting
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythms right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I now you're mine
Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine
You've got to
Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time

Title: I See Red
Lyrics:
When my baby's walking down the street
I see red, I see red, I see red
How could someone wicked walk round free
I see red, I see red, I see red
I see red, I see red, (hey!)
I see red
I respect your wishes
You gave me such precious hours
What to do without you.
Squeezed me out of your life
Down the drain like molten toothpaste
I feel used and spat out
Poor old me
When my baby's walking down the street
I see red, I see red, I see red
How could someone wicked walk round free
I see red, I see red, I see red
I see red, I see red, (hey!)
I see red
I'm fed up with crying
My despair is dying,
Turning into rage, day by day
Green before you met me
In the pink when you let me love you
I was blue when you let me down
Black and blue
When my baby's walking down the street
I see red, I see red, I see red
How could someone wicked walk round free
I see red, I see red, I see red
I see red, I see red, (hey!)
I see red
Mmmoh
(Ahhhrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Go, go, go, go!
I see red, I see red, I see red
I see red, I see red, I see red
Oooh I see red, (hey!)
I see red, I see red, I see red (I see red)
I see red, I see red, I see red (I see red)
I see red, I see red, I see red (I see red)
I see red, I see red, I see red (I see red)
I see red, I see red, I see red (I see red)

Title: Try A Little Tenderness
Lyrics:
Oh, she may be weary
Young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah yeah
...
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah
...
You know she's waiting
...
Just anticipating
For things that she'll never, never, never, never possess, yeah yeah
...
But while she's there waiting, without them
Try a little tenderness [(that's all you gotta do)]
...
It's not just sentimental, no, no, no
...
She has her grief and care, yeah yeah yeah
But the soft words, they are spoke so gentle, yeah
...
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah
...
You won't regret it, no, no
...
Some girls they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness, yeah
...
But it's all so easy
All you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah
...
All you gotta do is, man, hold her where you want her
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her, try, try
Just try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah
...
You got to know how to love her, man, you'll be surprised, man
You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave
...
You've got to hold her and rub her softly
Try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah

You've got to rub her gentle man, all you gotta do, no no
You've got to love her, squeeze her, don't tease her

Title: You Give Love A Bad Name
Lyrics:
Shot through the heart,
And you're to blame!
Darlin', you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free
Oh! You're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me,
The damage is done
Shot through the heart,
And you're to blame!
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name!
(Bad name)
Hey, you give love a bad name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Whoa! You're a loaded gun
Whoa! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me,
The damage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to blame!
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name!
(Bad name)
You give love, oh!
OH!
Shot through the heart,
And you're to blame!
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name!

Title: Angels
Lyrics:
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go
When we're grey and old
'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead
And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

You're as cold as ice
you're willing to sacrifice our love
you never take advice
someday you'll pay the price, i know

closing the door

You're digging for gold
yet throwing away
a fortune in feelings
but someday you'll pay
You're as cold as ice
you're willing to sacrifice our love
you want paradise
but someday you'll pay the price, i know
I've seen it before
it happens all the time
closing the door
you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
yet throwing away
a fortune in feelings
but someday you'll pay
you know that you are

as cold as ice to me

Title: Torn
Lyrics:
I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, He came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well You couldn't be that man that I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
I don't know him anymore
There's nothin' where he used to lie
Our conversation has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's fine
I'm torn
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn
So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now
I don't care, I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch
I'm torn
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn, torn
There's nothing where he used to lie
My inspiration has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's right
I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am ashamed
Bound and broken on the floor
You're a little late
I'm already torn, torn

Right now
I am an antichrist
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passerby
'Cause I wanna be Anarchy
No dog's body.
Anarchy from the U.K.
It's coming sometime and maybe.
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line.
Your future dream is a shopping scheme.
'Cause I
I wanna be Anarchy
In this city.
How many ways to get what you want
I use the best
I use the rest.
I use the enemy
I use anarchy.
'Cause I wanna be Anarchy.
It's the only way to be.
Is this the M.P.L.A. or
Is this the U.D.A. or
Is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.K.
Or just another country
Another council tenacy
I wanna be Anarchy.
And I wanna be Anarchy.
Oh what a name
And I wanna be an anarchist
Get pissed Destroy!

Title: You Oughta Know
Lyrics:
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me, is she perverted like me
Would she go down on your in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you die, 'til you die
but you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
But it was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you die, 'til you die
but you're sill alive
And I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know
'Cause the joke that you made in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it
And every time I scratch my nails
down someone else's back I hope you feel it... well can you feel it
Well I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know
I'm here to remind you
of the mess you left when you went away
it's not fair to deny me
of the cross I bear that you gave to me
you, you, you oughta know

Title: This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)
Lyrics:
Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb, burn with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's ok I know nothing's wrong...nothing
Hi yo I got plenty of time
Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up + say goodnight...say goodnight
Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be where I'll be
Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all tose kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head ah ooh

Title: Funky Cold Medina
Lyrics:
Alright, dig it
Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin' def, yo, what's up with L O C?
The girls is all jockin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, "Why you so fly?" he said, "Funky Cold Medina"
This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina
You know what I'm sayin'?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal
I went up to this girl, she said, "Hi, my name is Sheena"
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, "I'd like a drink," I said, "Ehm okay, I'll go get it"
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina
You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies
Ya know?
Break it down
Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on, The Love Connection
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' 'bout plans for our weddin'
I said, "Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya"
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina
Ya, know what I'm sayin'
That Medina's a monster, y'all

Title: You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth
Lyrics:
[Spoken:]
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
[Girl:] Will he offer me his mouth?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his teeth?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his jaws?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his hunger?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Again, will he offer me his hunger?
[Boy:] Yes!
[Girl:] And will starve without me?
[Boy:] Yes!
[Girl:] And does he love me?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Yes.
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
[Girl:] Yes.
[Boy:] I bet you say that to all the boys!
[Sung:]
It was a hot summer night 
beach was burning
fog crawling over the sand
When I listen to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars Falling through your trembling hands
You were licking your lips and lipstick shining
dying just to ask for a taste
(oh now) lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste
well You hold me so close knees grow weak
soul is flying high above the ground
trying to speak but no matter what I do
just can't seem to make any sound
And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
oh I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me
You took the words right out of my mouth
oh I swear it's true
I was just about to say I love you (love you)
you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh yeah yeah yeah
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh baby
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh you took the words - oh
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh, you know you did, you know, you know, you know you did, yeah yeah
(must have been while you were kissing me)
uh, you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
uh, you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
uh, you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were kissing me)
uh, you took the words right out of my mouth!
uh, you took the words right out of my mouth!
oh, oh oh yeah
(must have been while you were kissing me)
oh, you took the words right out of my mouth
(must have been while you were)
you took the words right out of my mouth
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
(took the words right out of my mouth
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me)
you took the words right out of my mouth
stand up and sing this song!
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
from your heart!
you took the words right out of my mouth
from your soul!
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
you took the words right out of my mouth
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
one big one
you took the words right out of my mouth
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
you took the words right out of my mouth
oh, it must have been while you were kissing me
you took the words right out of my mouth

Title: Golden Brown
Lyrics:
Golden Brown texture like sun
Lays me down with my mind she runs
Throughout the night
No need to fight
Never a frown with Golden Brown
Every time just like the last
On her ship tied to the mast
To distant lands
Takes both my hands
Never a frown with Golden Brown
Golden Brown, finer temptress
Through the ages she's heading west
From far away
Stays for a day
Never a frown with Golden Brown
(La la la la la la la la leeeah)
Never a frown
With Golden Brown
Never a frown
With Golden Brown

Title: Enter Sandman
Lyrics:
Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite, yeah
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Yeah heah
Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take
(Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Exit: light
Enter: night
Grain of sand
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Yeah ahaaha
Boo
Yeah yeah
Yo oh
We're off to never never land
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Title: Confide In Me
Lyrics:
I stand in the distance
I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance
Should it matter who you are
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
Confide in me, confide in me
I can keep a secret
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children free
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
Confide in me, confide in me
Confide in me, confide in me
Stick or twist the choice is yours
Hit or miss what's mine is yours
Stick or twist the choice is yours
Hit or miss what's mine is yours
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
Confide in me, confide in me
Confide in me, confide in me
And you will see what we can be
Confide in me, confide in me
And you will see what we can be

Title: Little Lies
Lyrics:
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies
Oh no-no, you can't disguise
You can't disguise
No, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you'll understand there's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart, let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies
Oh no-no, you can't disguise
You can't disguise
No, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies
Oh no-no, you can't disguise
You can't disguise
No, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies
Oh no-no, you can't disguise
You can't disguise
No, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

Title: Ashes To Ashes
Lyrics:
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed, love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing, just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said, to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said, to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said, to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom...

Title: Big Yellow Taxi
Lyrics:
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
They took all the trees
And put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And they put up a parking lot
Hey farmer farmer
Put away that D.D.T. now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please!
Dont it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi
Took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
I said don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got till its gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

Title: I Shot The Sheriff
Lyrics:
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)
Yeah! All around in my home town
They're tryin' to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:
Oh, now, now. Oh!
(I shot the sheriff.) - the sheriff.
(But I swear it was in selfdefence.)
Oh, no! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!
I say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -
(And they say it is a capital offence.)
Yeah! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!
Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what, I don't know:
Every time I plant a seed
He said kill it before it grow -
He said kill them before they grow.
And so:
Read it in the news:
(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!
(But I swear it was in self-defence.)
Where was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)
I say: I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:
If I am guilty I will pay.
(I shot the sheriff,)
But I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy)
I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!
(I shot the sheriff.) I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)
Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be:
Every day the bucket a-go a well
One day the bottom a-go drop out
One day the bottom a-go drop out.
I say:
I - I - I - I shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!
I - I (shot the sheriff) -
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!

Lyrics:
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what, how much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls
West End girls
(How much do you need?)
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh, West End town, a dead-end world

Title: Hallelujah
Lyrics:
I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?
And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Ooh my little pretty one, pretty one.
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?
Ooh you make my motor run, my motor run.

Never gonna stop, give it up.
Such a dirty mind. Always get it up for the touch
of the younger kind. My my my i yi woo.

Come a little closer huh, ah will ya huh.
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona.
Keeping it a mystery gets to me
Running down the length of my thighs, Sharona

Always get it up for the touch

Title: One
Lyrics:
Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame
You say, one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One!
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life, with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

What will you do when you get lonely?
No one waiting by your side
You've been running and hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride
Layla
Got me on my knees

Begging darling please

Darling won't you ease my worried mind?
Tried to give you consolation

Like a fool I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down
Layla
Got me on my knees

Begging darling please

Darling won't you ease my worried mind?
Make the best of the situation
For I finally go insane
Please don't say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain

Title: Time Of Your Life (Good Riddance)
Lyrics:
Another turning point
A fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist
Directs you where to go
So make the best of this test
And don't ask why
It's not a question
But a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable
But in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs
And still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf
In good health and good time
Tattoos of memories
And dead skin on trial
For what it's worth
It was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable
But in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable
But in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable
But in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

Title: Smoke On The Water
Lyrics:
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

Lyrics:
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please...

Oh, can't you see

Title: Wish You Were Here
Lyrics:
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue sky from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here

Title: Hey Jude
Lyrics:
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
Well, you know that it's a fool, who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Hey Jude, don't let me down
For you have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do, the movement you need
Is on your shoulder
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
You take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
Better, better, better, better, better

Title: Road To Nowhere
Lyrics:
Well, we know where we're goin'
But we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowin'
But we can't say what we've seen
And we're not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it out
We're on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
I'm feelin' okay this mornin'
And you know
We're on a road to paradise
Here we go, here we go
We're on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
Maybe you wonder where you are
I don't care
Here is where time is on our side
Take you there, take you there
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all right
Would you like to come along?
And you could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all right
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all right
Would you like to come along?
You could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all right
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere

Title: No Woman No Cry
Lyrics:
No, woman no cry
No, woman no cry
No, woman no cry
No, woman no cry
Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Ob-observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet (meet)
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way (way)
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
And no, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
Dear, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry
Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As it was logwood burnin' through the night (night)
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you (ooh)
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone, I mean
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right, yeah
Everything's gonna be all right
No, woman, no cry
Oh, no, no (no, woman no cry)
Woman, little sister, don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light
As it was logwood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
Woman, little darlin', sayin' don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry
Hey, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry
Now, little sister, don't shed no tears
No, woman no cry

Title: Jeremy
Lyrics:
At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun, arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember pickin' on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooo, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin', ooo, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Try to forget this
Try to erase this, from the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today

This land was never bought and sold
The planting of the union jack
Never changed our law at all
Now two river run their course
Seperated for so long
I'm dreaming of a brighter day
When the waters will be one

Title: Love Will Tear Us Apart
Lyrics:
When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold turned away on your side?
Is my timing that flawed, our respect run so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Do you cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed?
Get a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Is it something so good just can't function no more?
But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
She's running out the door
She's running out
She's run, run, run, run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep

What the hell am I doin' here?

Title: Great Southern Land
Lyrics:
Standing at the limit of an endless ocean
Stranded like a runaway lost at sea
City on a rainy day down in the harbor
Watching as the gray clouds shadow the bay
Looking everywhere 'cause I had to find you
This is not the way that I remember it here
Anyone will tell you it's a prisoner island
Hidden in the summer for a million years
Great Southern Land
Burned you black
So you look into the land, it will tell you a story
Story about a journey ended long ago
Listen to the motion of the wind in the mountains
Maybe you can hear them talking like I do
They're gonna betray you, they're gonna forget you
Are you gonna let them take you over that way?
Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land
You walk alone
Like a primitive man
And they make it work
With sticks and bones
See their hungry eyes
It's a hungry home
I hear the sound
Of the strangers' voices
I see their hungry eyes
Their hungry eyes
Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land
They burned you black
Black against the ground
Standing at the limit of an endless ocean
Stranded like a runaway lost at sea
City on a rainy day down in the harbor
Watching as the gray clouds shadow the bay
Looking everywhere, I had to find you
This is not the way that I remember it here
Anyone will tell you it's a prisoner island
Hidden in the summer for a million years
Great Southern Land
In the sleeping sun
You walk alone
With the ghost of time
Well, they burned you black
Black against the ground
And they make it work
With rocks and sand
I hear the sound
Of the strangers' voices
I see their hungry eyes
Their hungry eyes
Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land
You walk alone
Like a primitive man
You walk alone
With the ghost of time
And they burned you black
Yeah, they burned you black
Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land

Title: Space Oddity
Lyrics:
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom (Ten, nine, eight, seven, six)
Commencing countdown, engines on (Five, four, three, two)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (Two, one, liftoff)
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear-
And I'm floating around my tin can
Far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Title: Like A Prayer
Lyrics:
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
Like a prayer
Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there

Title: Working Class Man
Lyrics:
working hard to make a living
bringing shelter from the rain
a father's son left to carry on
blue denim in his veins
oh oh oh he's a working class man
well he's a steel town disciple
he's a legend of his kind
he's running like a cyclone
across the wild mid western sky
oh oh oh he's a working class man
he believes in god and elvis
he gets out when he can
he did his time in vietnam
still mad at uncle sam
he's a simple man
with a heart of gold
in a complicated land
oh he's a working class man
well he loves a little woman
someday he'll make his wife
saving all the overtime
for the one love of his life
he ain't worried about tomorrow
cause he just made up his mind
life's too short for burning bridges
take it one day at a time
oh oh oh he's a working class man
oh oh oh he's a working class man
oh yeah
yes he is
well he's a working class man
oh
ma ma . . . . . . . i tell you he's a working class man

Title: Clocks
Lyrics:
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing
You are
You are
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing
Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? singing
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
You are
You are
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go

Title: All My Life
Lyrics:
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost.
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my breath
Will I find something in that
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide
On and on I've got nothing to hide
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Done done and on to the next one
Done I'm done and I'm
On to the next.

Title: Under The Bridge
Lyrics:
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
sometimes I feel like my only friend
is the city I live in, the city of angels
lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie.
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
it's hard to believe that I'm all alone
at least I have her love, the city she loves me
lonely as I am, together we cry
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way
well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh no, no, no, yeah, yeah
love me, I say, yeah yeah
(under the bridge downtown)
is where I drew some blood
(under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(under the bridge downtown)
forgot about my love
(under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
oh no no no no, yeah yeah
here I stay

Title: All Along The Watchtower
Lyrics:
"There must be some kind of way out of here,"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth."
"No reason to get excited,"
The thief, he kindly spoke.
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late."
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

Title: Wuthering Heights
Lyrics:
Out on the Wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too
Bad dreams in the night
You told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold
let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold,
let me in your window
Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream
My only master
Too long I roamed in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold
let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold,
let me in your window
Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathyyyyyy
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold,
let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold,
let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy, I've come home i'm so cold

Title: Faith
Lyrics:
Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you
Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door
'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith
Baby, I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Yes, I gotta have faith
Mm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I'll just have to wait
Because I got to have faith
I gotta have faith
I got to, got to, got to have faith
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
(I've just got to have faith)
Oh, oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
'Cause I gotta have faith
Mm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Hold your head up
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on
Keep your head up
Movin' on
Hold your head up
Movin' on

Lyrics:
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
I've been running hot
You got me ticking gonna blow my top
If you start me up, if you start me up
I'll never stop, never stop, never stop, never stop
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up
If you start it up
Kick on the starter, give it all you've got
(You got, you got)
I can't compete
With the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slide it up, slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up
Start me up
Ah, you've got to, you've got to
Never, never, never stop
Start it up
Ah, start it up, never, never, never
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind, at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
You start it up
Love the day when we will never stop
Never stop, never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come
You, you, you make a dead man come.

Title: What A Wonderful World
Lyrics:
I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom
For me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying
"I love you"
I hear babies cry
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah

Title: London Calling
Lyrics:
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
London calling now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Meltdown expected and the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running but I have no fear
London is drowning and I live by the river
London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling upon the zombies of death
Quit holding out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't wanna shout
But when we were talking I saw you nodding out
London calling see we ain't got no highs
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error but I have no fear
London is drowning and I, I live by the river
Now get this
London calling yes I was there too
An' you know what they said? Well some of it was true
London calling at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
I never felt so much a'like a'like a'like

Title: Candle In The Wind
Lyrics:
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

Lyrics:
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, ooh, yeah
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
No, nothing else matters

I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

Title: Girls Just Want To Have Fun
Lyrics:
I come home, in the morning light
My mother says "When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh momma dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun
The phone rings, in the middle of the night
My father yells:"What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna (girls) have fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)
Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have
That's all they really want
Is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have (girls) fun (they want)
(Wanna have fun)
(Girls)
(Wanna have)
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh girls
Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Girls, girls just wanna have fun
When the workin'
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun
They just wanna, they just wanna (girls)
They just wanna, they just wanna (Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fu-un
(They just wanna, they just wanna)
When the workin'
When the working day is done, (They just wanna, they just wanna)
Oh, when the working day is done (Oh, girls)
(Girls just wanna have fun)
Oh, girls
Girls just wanna have fun
(They just wanna, they just wanna)...

Title: Reckless
Lyrics:
Meet me down by the jetty landing
Where the the pontoons bump and sway
I see the others reading, standing
As the Manly Ferry cuts its way to Circular Quay
Hear the Captain blow his whistle
So long she's been away
I miss our early morning wrestle
Not a very Happy way to start the day
She don't like That kind of behaviour
She don't like That kind of behaviour
So, throw down your guns
Don't be so reckless
Throw down your guns
Don't be so
Feel like Scott of the Antarctic
Base camp too far away
A Russian sun beneath the Arctic
Burke and Wills and camels
Initials in the tree
She don't like That kind of behaviour
She don't like That kind of behaviour
So, throw down your guns
Don't be so reckless
Throw down your guns
Don't be so

Title: Throw Your Arms Around Me
Lyrics:
I will come for you at night time
I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go running along your street
I will squeeze the life out of you
You will make me laugh and make me cry
We will never forget it
You will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
We may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
I dreamed of you at night time
And I watched you in your sleep
I met you in high places
I touched your head and touched your feet
So if you disappear out of view
You know, I will never say goodbye
Though I try to forget it
You will make me call your name and I'll shout it to the blue summer sky
We may never meet again
So shed your skin and lets get started
And you will throw your arms around me
Yeah you will throw you arms around me
(repeat to end)

Lyrics:
Unforgettable, that's what you are
Unforgettable though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so Unforgettable
Thinks that I am Unforgettable too
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so Unforgettable
Thinks that I am Unforgettable too

Title: Never Tear Us Apart
Lyrics:
Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart
I (Don't ask me)
I was standing (You know it's true)
Mm, you were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
You (Don't ask me)
You were standing (You know it's true)
I was there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (We're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
I-I-I
I was standing
You were there

Title: Last Goodbye
Lyrics:
This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over
Just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for
More than you'll ever know
This is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face
Why can't we overcome this wall
Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all
Kiss me
Please kiss me
But kiss me out of desire, babe
And not consolation
You know it makes me so angry
'Cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry
This is our last goodbye
Did you say "No, this can't happen to me"
And did you rush to your phone to call?
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying
"Maybe... you didn't know him at all"
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know
The bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory
Offer signs that it's over
It's over

Lyrics:
I got you
That's all I want
I won't forget
That's a whole lot
I don't go out
Not now that you're in
Sometimes we shout
But that's no problem
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
Look at you
You're a pageant
You're everything
That I've imagined
But something's wrong
I feel uneasy
You show me
Tell me you're not teasing
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell me you're not lying
There's no doubt
Not when I'm with you
When I'm without
I stay in my room
Where do you go
I get no answer
You're always out
It gets on my nerves
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
But I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell me you're not lying
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying

Title: Billie Jean
Lyrics:
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
Of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me "be careful of what you do"
"And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me "be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told "my baby, that's a threat"
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
No, she is not just my baby
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Call me, Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is not at the scene
Billie jean is not my lover

Title: Rhiannon
Lyrics:
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised to you heaven?
Will you ever win?
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
All your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised to you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised to you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

Oooooh
Taken by
Taken by the sky
Taken by
Taken by the sky
Taken by
Taken by the sky

Love's a state of mind

Title: Graceland
Lyrics:
The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a National guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war
I'm going to Graceland
Graceland
In Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poorboys and Pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland
She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poorboys and Pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow
In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland

Title: Down Under
Lyrics:
Traveling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:
Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover
Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot tall and full of muscle
I said... Do you speak-a my language?
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:
I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover
Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man... Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty
And he said:
Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover
Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover
Oh! Do you come from a land down under (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover

Title: Beds Are Burning
Lyrics:
Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back
How can we dance
When our earth is turning
How do we sleep
While our beds are burning
How can we dance
When our earth is turning
How do we sleep
While our beds are burning
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
Four wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back
How can we dance
When our earth is turning
How do we sleep
While our beds are burning
How can we dance
When our earth is turning
How do we sleep
While our beds are burning
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent now
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
We're gonna give it back
How can we dance
When our earth is turning
How do we sleep
While our beds are burning

Title: American Pie
Lyrics:
A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
Did you write the book of love, and do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll, can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
Now for ten years we've been on our own, and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen in a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
Helter skelter in a summer swelter, the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
Oh, and there we were all in one place, a generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'
bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
I met a girl who sang the blues, and I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"
They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' This'll be the day that I die"

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my darling, you, hmm
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I will always love you

Title: Dancing Queen
Lyrics:
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, oh
See that girl, watch that scene
Diging the Dancing Queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, oh
See that girl, watch that scene
Diging the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, oh
See that girl, watch that scene
Diging the Dancing Queen

Title: New York New York
Lyrics:
Start spreading the news
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up, in a city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap
This little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York
New York, New York
I want to wake up in that city
That never sleeps
And find I'm hey number one
Top of the list
King of the hill
Hey number one
These are little town blues
They have all melted away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York
And I
If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York, New York

Title: Thriller
Lyrics:
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurkin'in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller at night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
Thriller
Thriller at night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight
Night creatures callin'
The dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller
Thriller at night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Thriller)
(Thriller at night)
So let me hold you tight
And share a
(Killer, diller, chiller)
(Thriller here tonight)
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Thriller)
(Thriller at night)
So let me hold you tight
And share a
(Killer, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'alls neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller))
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller at night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

Title: More Than A Feeling
Lyrics:
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away
It's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky
It's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
She slipped away
It's more than a feeling
(More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play
(More than a feeling)
I begin dreaming
(More than a feeling)
'Til I see Marianne walk away

Title: Smells Like Teen Spirit
Lyrics:
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
And I forget, just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial

Title: Khe Sahn
Lyrics:
I left my heart to the sappers 'round Khe Sahn
And I sold my soul with my cigarettes, to a black market man
I've had to Vietnam cold turkey, from the ocean to the silver city
And it's only other vets could understa-and
'Bout the long forgotten dockside guarantees
How there were no V-day heroes in nineteen seventy-three
How we sailed into Sydney Harbour, I saw an old friend but I couldn't kiss her
And she was lined, and I was home to the lucky land
She was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty, until they'd found there chosen one
And their legs were often open but their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long paypackets lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
The carparks made me jumpy and I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and novacaine
So I worked across the country from end to end
I tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend
I held a job on an oil-rig, a-flyin' choppers when I could
But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend
And I've travelled round the world from year to year-ear-ear
And each one found me aimless, one more year the worse for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia, you know the answer sure ain't there
But I'm driftin' north to check things out agai-ai-ain
Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost go-one
And only seven flyin' hours, till I'll be landin' in Hong Kong
And there ain't nothin' like the kisses from a jaded Chinese princess
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night lo-ong
Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone-aca

Title: Stairway To Heaven
Lyrics:
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it really makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Title: Bohemian Rhapsody
Lyrics:
Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows) I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go (never)
Never let you go, let me go
Never let me go, ooh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah nothing really matters
Anyone can see nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows

Title: Imagine
Lyrics:
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
